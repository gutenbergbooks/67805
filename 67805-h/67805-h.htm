<p class="cap">“I’d hate to live up here in summer, Bert,” said
Ted Trafford, carefully easing his five feet
and ten inches of tired, aching body to the
window-seat and turning a perspiring face to
the faint breeze that entered. “It must be hotter
than Tophet.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s up high enough to get the air, isn’t
it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s high enough, all right! If I had to
climb those three flights of stairs a dozen times a
day——”</p>

<p>“Wonder why slate stairs seem harder than
others,” said Nick Blake, fanning himself with a
magazine.</p>

<p>“Because they <em>are</em> harder, naturally.” Ted
looked about the study. “It isn’t so bad, though,
when you get here. And I dare say it’ll be fine
in winter. You haven’t an open fireplace,
though.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span></p>

<p>“I had one last year in 19. It was only a
bother. If I had a fire the ashes got all over
the shop. Besides, it was always so warm in the
room that when I wanted one I had to keep all
the windows open. There’s dandy steam heat
in Lothrop.”</p>

<p>“There is in Trow, but——”</p>

<p>“Oh, get out, Ted!” interrupted Nick. “I’ve
been in your study when the thermometer wasn’t
over fifty! Everyone knows that Trow’s a regular
barn in cold weather.”</p>

<p>“Well, some days, when the wind’s a certain
way——”</p>

<p>“Trow’s older than this, isn’t it?” asked Bert
Winslow. He had yielded the window-seat to
his visitors and was stretched out on the leather
cushions of a Morris chair, the back of which
he had lowered to the last notch. It was very
warm in Number 29, for the study was on the
top floor of the building and overhead the September
sun had been shining all day on the slate
roof. Then, too, since the Fall Term did not
begin for two days yet, all but a few of the rooms
were closed and what little breeze there was
found scant circulation. Bert had opened the
door and windows of 32, across the corridor, and
that helped to some extent, but Lothrop Hall
seemed to have caught all the heat of the past<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
summer and to be bent on hoarding it on the top
floor.</p>

<p>“Why, yes,” Ted was replying. “Trow was
the first of the new buildings. It’s been built
about twelve years, I think. I dare say the heating
is better here and in Manning. Still, I never
have any trouble keeping warm. You chaps
over here are a pampered lot, anyway, with your
common room and your library and your recreation
room and—and your shower baths and all
the rest of it! Sybarites, that’s what you are!”</p>

<p>“Don’t judge us all, Ted, by this palatial suite,”
begged Nick. “Some of us live in monastic simplicity,
in one bare little room.”</p>

<p>“I’ve seen your bare little room,” replied Ted,
smiling. “You’re a lot of mollycoddles, the
bunch of you. What time is it?”</p>

<p>Nick, stretched at the other end of the seat,
his cheek on the windowsill and his gaze fixed on
the shadowed stretches of the campus below,
moved his hand toward his fob only to let it fall
idly again.</p>

<p>“Look yourself, you lazy beggar,” he murmured.</p>

<p>“Seventeen to five,” said Bert, dropping his
watch back with a sigh. Ted digested the information
in silence for several minutes. Nick
continued his somnolent regard of the campus and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
Bert thoughtfully tapped together the toes of his
rubber-soled shoes.</p>

<p>“More than an hour to supper,” said Ted
finally. “Not that I’m particularly hungry,
though. It’s too hot to eat. Honest, fellows, I
believe it’s hotter up here than it is in New York!
If this last week is a sample of New England
summer weather I don’t see why folks come here
the way they do.”</p>

<p>“It’s the fine, pure air,” muttered Nick.</p>

<p>“Air! That’s the trouble. There isn’t any.
This place is hotter than Broadway on the Fourth
of July!”</p>

<p>“There’s a breeze now,” said Nick. “Get it?”</p>

<p>“Sure; it almost blew out the door,” replied
Ted sarcastically. “Come on over to my place.
It’s a heap cooler, I’ll bet.”</p>

<p>“I’m too tired to move,” protested his host.
“We can go downstairs, if you like. I dare say
it’s cooler in the common room.”</p>

<p>“Who’s with you this year?” asked Ted, his
gaze traveling to the open door of the bedroom
at the left.</p>

<p>“Fellow by the name of Ordway, or something.
Comes from Maryland. Upper middler,
I think.”</p>

<p>“How’d you happen to go in with him?
Thought you liked rooming alone.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span></p>

<p>“So I do, but I’ve had my eye on this suite
ever since I came over from Manning. Gus Livingstone
and I had it all fixed to take it together
and applied last fall for it. Then, when Gus
didn’t come back after winter vacation, I tried
to get Nick to come in with me, and——”</p>

<p>“I wanted to hard enough,” said Nick, without
turning, “but my dad kicked like a steer. He
said seven hundred was too much for his pocket.”</p>

<p>“Wow!” exclaimed Ted. “Is that what this
stands you? Seven hundred each?”</p>

<p>Bert nodded. “Yes, it’s high in price and elevation
too.”</p>

<p>“What do you pay downstairs, Nick?”</p>

<p>“Three hundred. That’s what you pay, isn’t
it?”</p>

<p>“Two-fifty. Seven hundred for room and
board, a hundred and fifty for tuition and a couple
of hundred for incidentals; total, ten hundred
and fifty a year! Say, Bert, I’ll bet your old
man will be mighty glad when you’re through
here!”</p>

<p>“Then it’ll be college,” answered Bert, “and I
guess that won’t be much cheaper. We do
cost our folks a lot of money, though, don’t
we?”</p>

<p>“We’re worth it, though,” said Nick. “At
least, some of us are.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span></p>

<p>Ted Trafford laughed. “I’m worth two-fifty
and you’re worth three, eh? And Bert’s worth
seven. Well, it’s a peach of a suite, all right,
Bert, but I’d just as lief have my dive. Besides,
I’ve got it to myself. When you have another
chap with you he always wants to cut up when
you want to plug. Not for mine, thanks!”</p>

<p>“Single blessedness for me, too,” murmured
Nick. “When I was in Manning in junior year
I roomed with young Fessenden and we nearly
got fired because we were always scrapping. He
was a quarrelsome little brute!”</p>

<p>“What happened to him? Did you kill him
finally?”</p>

<p>“No, but I wanted to lots of times. He quit
the next year. Went to some school in Pennsylvania.
His folks wanted him nearer home, he
said. I don’t see why they should!”</p>

<p>“Hope you like your new chum, Bert,” said
Ted. “Broadway’s a funny name, though, eh?”</p>

<p>“Ordway,” Bert corrected. “I dare say we’ll
get along. I have a nice disposition.”</p>

<p>Nick giggled and Bert gazed across at him
speculatively. “Of course everyone knows why
Nick rooms alone,” he added. “He’s too mean
to live with.”</p>

<p>Nick raised his head to answer, but thought
better of it. A vagrant breeze crept through the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
windows and the boys said, “A-ah!” in ecstatic
chorus.</p>

<p>“Listen,” said Nick, suddenly propping himself
up on the cushions. “I’ve got a good
scheme!”</p>

<p>“Shoot!” replied Ted, yawning widely.</p>

<p>“After supper we’ll beat it down to the pool
and go in! Will you?”</p>

<p>“Ugh! Mud and frogs!” said Bert.</p>

<p>“Mud and frogs your eye! It’s dandy if you
don’t go to wading around. We don’t have to
stay in the pool, anyway. Rules don’t apply before
term begins. We can go in the river. No
one will see us.”</p>

<p>“Safest thing,” said Ted, “is to find a canoe
and upset, the way we did a couple of years
ago. Pete used to go crazy and threaten to report
us, but he couldn’t prove it wasn’t an accident.”</p>

<p>“Aren’t any canoes out yet, I guess,” said Bert.
“And the boat house is locked.”</p>

<p>“Never mind your old canoes,” said Nick.
“That’s an underhand scheme, anyway. Fair and
open’s my motto! Oh, say, but that water’s going
to feel good!”</p>

<p>“That isn’t such an awfully rotten idea,” said
Ted. “I’m blessed if I know where to look for
my trunks, though.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span></p>

<p>“You don’t need ’em. It’ll be dark by half-past
seven.”</p>

<p>“Not with a moon shining, you silly chump,”
said Bert. “You can take a pair of running trunks
of mine, Ted. Only, worse luck, I’ll have to unpack
that box over there.” He pulled himself
from the chair with a sigh of resignation and
kicked experimentally at the lid of the packing
case. “Wonder where I can find a hatchet,” he
muttered. “Got anything I can bust this lid off
with, Nick?”</p>

<p>“Got a screwdriver I use on my typewriter,”
responded Nick helpfully.</p>

<p>“What time is it?” inquired Ted again.</p>

<p>“Find out, you lazy beast,” replied Bert. “Tell
me how to get this thing open, you chaps.”</p>

<p>“Pick it up and drop it on the floor a few
times,” said Ted.</p>

<p>“Bore a hole and put a dynamite cartridge in,”
suggested Nick.</p>

<p>“Oh, all right, then you go without the trunks,”
said Bert, returning to his chair. “I’d like to
know why I pounded a million dollars’ worth of
nails into it, anyway.” There was no solution
forthcoming, it seemed. Nick had returned to
his study of the world outside and Ted had picked
up the discarded magazine and was idly looking
at the pictures. Bert sighed again and stretched<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
his arms overhead. Then he said “<em>Ouch!</em>” suddenly
and loudly and ruefully rubbed a shoulder.
Ted looked over and grinned.</p>

<p>“Sore?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Sore as a boil! You wouldn’t think a fellow
would get so soft in summer, swimming and playing
tennis and everything. I wish Bonner would
let us off tomorrow. I think he might. It
wouldn’t hurt him to give us a day’s rest.”</p>

<p>“He’s going to give us the afternoon off,” replied
Ted. “Only morning practice tomorrow.
You can thank me for it, Bert. It was my pretty
little thought.”</p>

<p>“He wouldn’t have seen me on the field tomorrow,
anyway,” remarked Nick. “I’m going
down to the junction to meet Guy at three-something.
Come on with me.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t make that trip in this weather for
the King of England, much less Guy Murtha,”
responded Bert impressively.</p>

<p>“I’ll buy you ice cream,” tempted Nick. Bert
shook his head.</p>

<p>“Will you come, Ted?” asked Nick.</p>

<p>“I will—not! I love Guy like a brother,
<em>but</em>——”</p>

<p>“Oh, you fellows make me weary!” sighed
Nick. “No sporting blood at all! No——”</p>

<p>“Is that your idea of sporting?” jeered Ted.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
“Get on a hot, stuffy little one-horse train and
dawdle down to Needham Junction, four miles
away, in something like half an hour? I’ve made
that trip once this fall and, Fortune aiding me, I
shan’t make it again!”</p>

<p>“Come on to supper,” said Bert. “It’s almost
a quarter of. It will be cooler over there on the
steps than it is here, too.”</p>

<p>“Just when I was beginning to get comfortable,”
mourned Nick. “Say, Ted, did you do this
last year?”</p>

<p>“Sure! Do what?”</p>

<p>“Come up for early practice.”</p>

<p>“I did. And we had ten days of it last fall
instead of only a week. You fellows needn’t
kick!”</p>

<p>“I do kick, though, Teddy, old scout! Look
here, you! I gave up a whole week of the best
sort of fun at Deal Beach to come up here and
frizzle and fry in my juices and chase a contemptible
football over a sun-smitten cow-pasture!
Needn’t kick, eh? Why, man, back there there’s
a nice cool breeze off the ocean and a band playing
moosics and piles of eats and—and nothing
to do but play around! And just because I’m—I’m
patriotic enough and unselfish enough to leave
all that you lie there like a ton of bricks and
tell me I needn’t kick! I do kick! I’m kicking!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span></p>

<p>“I hear you,” murmured Ted. “Go on kicking.
Nobody’s going to miss you if you go back
to Deal Beach tomorrow. We could have got on
well enough without you, anyhow. You were
simply asked because we thought you’d feel hurt
if you weren’t.”</p>

<p>“I like your nerve!” gasped Nick. “My word!
Who’s been doing the work for five days out
there? Trying to get drive into you chaps is
like pulling teeth! Why, you miserable sandy-haired——”</p>

<p>“Oh, come on,” begged Bert. “I’m getting
hungry. Anyone want to wash up? Come along
if you do. You’ll have to wipe your hands on
your handkerchiefs, though. They haven’t given
us any towels yet.”</p>

<p>“What’s the good of washing if we’re going
in swimming later?” asked Nick, sprawling off
the window-seat.</p>

<p>“Because for once, old son, you’re dining with
gentlemen,” Ted answered, gripping the smaller
youth by the shoulders and propelling him towards
the door in the wake of Bert.</p>

<p>“Honest?” wailed Nick. “I’d much rather
dine with you, Ted!”</p>

<small>PLAYERS AND COACH</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">A few minutes later the three boys were
crossing the campus unhurriedly and
with an impressive disregard of “Keep
Off the Grass” signs. And three good-looking,
healthy, well-set-up youths they were. Their bare
heads—there wasn’t a hat among them—showed
three distinctly different colors. Ted Trafford’s
hair was sandy, Bert Winslow’s black, Nick
Blake’s reddish-brown. Between sandy hair and
brown lay a matter of four inches in height, with
black hair halving the difference. In build the trio
were again at variance. Ted was a big, broad-bodied
chap, Bert was slenderer, without being
thin, and Nick was at once short and slight. Although
Nick was only five months Bert’s junior—and
Bert was seventeen—his smallness made him
appear much younger. He had a thin face, deeply
tanned, and gray eyes. Nick’s usual expression
was one of intense, even somber, thoughtfulness.
He had, in fact, the appearance of a boy with a
deep and secret sorrow. But in his case appearances<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
were deceptive, or, if he had a sorrow, it
was merely that there are only a certain number
of ways to create mischief and that he had pretty
well exhausted them all.</p>

<p>Bert Winslow was a very normal-looking fellow
with good features, a healthy color under his
tan and a pair of eyes so darkly blue that they
seemed black. Ted’s features were more rugged,
like his body, and, if such a thing is possible, his
complexion was as sandy as his hair. He had a
wealth of freckles and two rather sleepy-looking
brown eyes very far apart. Ted’s countenance
expressed good nature first, and after that a sort
of quiet purposefulness. One wouldn’t have expected
brilliant mental feats of Ted, but one
would have expected him to succeed where physical
strength and dogged determination were demanded.
Ted thought slowly, reached conclusions
only after some effort, and then stuck immovably
to his conclusions. He had been three years at
Grafton School and during that time his great
ambition had been to captain the football team
in his senior year. He had attained that ambition
and had now substituted another, which was,
to put it in his own words, “Knock the tar out
of Mt. Morris in November!” Having accomplished
or failed in that, Ted would undoubtedly
drag another ambition from the recesses of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
mind. But at present that was enough. With
Ted it was always “one thing at a time.”</p>

<p>Between them, the three boys loitering across
the grass represented just three-elevenths of the
Grafton School Football Team. Captain Trafford
played right tackle, Bert Winslow was left
half-back and Nick Blake was quarter. Ted had
played on the School Team ever since he had entered
the lower middle class, which meant two
years. Bert, who was now an upper-middler, had
made his position only last season, beating out
Siedhof in the final contests. Nick had been second-string
quarter-back last year and now, owing
to the graduation of Balch, had automatically
succeeded to the position. Barring unforeseen and
unexpected accidents, each of the trio was certain
of playing the coming season through as first-choice.</p>

<p>At Grafton the school buildings stood in a row
midway across the campus, a three-acre expanse
of level turf intersected by gravel paths shaded
by elms and surrounded by an ancient fence of
granite posts and squared timbers, the latter
thoughtlessly set with an angle uppermost. In
shape the campus was a square with one corner
rounded off where Crumbie Street changed its
mind about continuing northward and swung
westward to River Street and, a half mile beyond<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
that, the station. River Street marked the westerly
limits of the school property all the way to
the river, which, in its turn, formed the southerly
boundary. The campus proper ended at School
Street, but successive purchases had added many
more acres between it and the Needham River,
so that now the school property extended in an
unbroken strip some two blocks wide from Needham
Street, at the back, all the way down to
the river. What was virtually a continuation of
the campus lay to the south of School Street, but,
since it was of later acquisition, it was, for some
unknown reason, called “the green.” A tree-bordered
path led through the middle of the green
to Front Street, and, across that quiet road, an ornamental
gateway of old brick and sandstone and
lacy ironwork. Set in the right-hand pillar was
a bronze tablet bearing the inscription: “Lothrop
Field. In Memory of Charles Parkinson
Lothrop, Class of 1911.”</p>

<p>Beyond the gateway the land sloped gently to
the river, and here was the Field House, near
at hand as one entered, the tennis courts to the
right, the diamond beyond them, the running track
to the left of the gate, with the School Team gridiron
inclosed in the blue-gray ribbon, and, further
toward the river, the practice field. Beyond that
again, near where Crumbie Street crossed by an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
old covered bridge on its way to Needham, stood
the boat house.</p>

<p>But we are too far afield, for our present destination
is that of the three boys whom we left
crossing the campus. At one corner of the green,
where River and School Streets intersect, stood
two old-fashioned white dwelling houses. The
one nearer River Street had been just there when
the land was bought by the School, but the second
had stood at the other end of the green and
had been moved to its present location to make
room for tennis courts. When, however, a few
years later, Lothrop Field had been presented to
the School the tennis courts were transferred
thither and now, save for the two white-clapboarded,
many-dormered houses, the green was
only a pleasant, shady expanse of close-cropped
sward. The old houses, used now as dormitories
since the buildings in the campus failed to meet
the requirements of the ever-increasing student
body, still retained the names of their former owners.
The larger one, nearer the side street, was
known as Morris House, the other as Fuller.</p>

<p>At a few minutes before six this afternoon the
front steps and the adjacent turf—there was no
such thing as a porch or piazza on either dwelling—were
sprinkled with boys. There seemed to
be at least two dozen of them. As a matter of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
fact, until Ted, Bert and Nick joined them, they
numbered exactly seventeen. In age they varied
from sixteen to twenty, although only one of them,
John Driver, commonly known as “Pop,” had attained
the latter age. Pop was, as he laughingly
explained it, “doing the four-year course in six.”
That was a slight exaggeration, for Pop had been
at Grafton only four years, was now a senior and
would undoubtedly be graduated next June
whether he was willing or not! He was big and
slow; slow to move, slow to speak and slow to
anger. He played right guard in a steady, highly-satisfactory
if not brilliant fashion.</p>

<p>Since this was Tuesday, the fellows who had
gathered from various and, in some instances, distant
parts of the country for early football practice,
had been at Grafton six days. Those six
days had been busy ones. There had been morning
and afternoon sessions on each day and the
weather had been almost unreasonably hot. More
than one of the candidates showed the result of
those strenuous days in his tired face and fagged
movements. Not one of the twenty who had been
bidden had, however, failed to respond. Those
summons meant a week less of vacation time and
an added week of hard labor, but it also meant
honor, for only the most likely of last year’s first
and second players had been called on. While the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
fellows were occupying their rooms in the dormitories,
neither of the big dining halls in Lothrop
and Manning were open and so they were being
served with meals at Morris where, in a room
and at a table designed to accommodate only
the dozen or fourteen residents of the two
houses, they were packed in like sardines in a
box.</p>

<p>However, none minded that so long as there
was plenty of food on the dishes and plenty of
milk in the big pitchers. Mr. Bonner, the coach,
arrived just as the crowd had squeezed themselves
to the two tables and had begun their onslaught.
Somehow he didn’t look quite like the popular
conception of a football coach. He was of only
medium size and height and had the preoccupied
expression of a business man with his mind on the
day’s sales. In age he was twenty-eight or -nine,
had a somewhat narrow face, brown hair and
eyes and wore a closely-trimmed mustache that
was several shades lighter than his hair. The
reason for the mustache was apparent when, on
close observation, what seemed at first to be a
natural crease running from one corner of his
mouth was seen to be a deep, white scar. The
mustache didn’t hide the whole of that scar but
it concealed the most of it. David Bonner had
acquired it in a certain hard-fought game when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
he was playing end in his junior year at Amherst,
and there was a story at Grafton to the effect that
his opponent in that contest had subsequently
fared much worse than Mr. Bonner had. However,
as the coach was a remarkably even-tempered
man, that may have been merely an invention
of someone’s imagination.</p>

<p>Supper proceeded with as much and probably
no more noise than is usual when twenty fairly
hungry youths are left to their own devices at
table. There was a good deal of loud talk, some
far from silent mastication, much rattling and
clashing of dishes and, it is not to be denied, some
horse-play toward the end of the meal. Two
capable if not over-neat waitresses flitted in and
out and did their best to supply the demands on
the kitchen. Now and then Coach Bonner’s voice
was raised in warning, but for the most part that
gentleman attended closely to the business of consuming
his supper, and it was not until cold rice
pudding had appeared as the final course that he
entered into the conversation to any extent. By
that time many of the fellows, having either
picked the raisins from their portion of the dessert
or engulfed it with the aid of much milk and
sugar, had moved back from the tables to loll
more comfortably half in, half off their chairs.
The four windows were wide open and a slight<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
breeze was swaying the curtain-cords, but the heat
of the day still lingered.</p>

<p>“I’ll trouble you for the milk, Willard,” said
the coach, eyeing his pudding with but slight enthusiasm.
“Thanks. Traf, I’ve been thinking
that maybe it would be well to cut out practise
tomorrow. You fellows have been at it pretty
hard and this weather is trying. I thought it
might be cooler tomorrow, but that sunset says
not. What do you think?”</p>

<p>“Oh, we ought to be able to stand a little work
in the morning, if we don’t do any in the afternoon.
Still, it’s just as you like, Coach. It is awfully
hot for football, and that’s a fact.”</p>

<p>“Have a heart, Ted!” implored Derry.</p>

<p>“That’s the scheme, sir,” exclaimed Nick Blake.
“It’s going to be hotter than ever tomorrow.”
Nick expertly thrust some bread crumbs down
Pop Driver’s neck. “We’d all be better for a
rest, sir. Just look at Pop here! Overcome by
the heat, Mr. Bonner!”</p>

<p>Pop, squirming and muttering, really looked as
if something was vastly wrong with him, but the
coach didn’t seem inclined to accept Nick’s theory.
He studied Pop’s spasms a moment in thoughtful
silence and then pushed back his chair.</p>

<p>“We’ll cut it out for tomorrow, then,” he announced
as he stood up. “And, by the way, Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
Fair will give us our breakfasts in the morning,
but we’ll have to shift for ourselves at noon.”</p>

<p>“They’re going to serve cold lunch in Manning
at noon, sir,” said one of the boys. “I guess we
can get in on that.”</p>

<p>“All right. Next practise, then, will be Thursday
at three-thirty. Traf, you look me up tomorrow
evening, will you? There are one or two
things—and bring Quinn along with you, please.
Don’t stay around here, fellows. Give Mrs. Fair
a chance to get these tables cleaned off. Good
night.”</p>

<small>A MOONLIGHT PLUNGE</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Coach Bonner passed out briskly and
the fellows, with much scraping of chairs
and good-natured horseplay, followed.
Twilight was settling over the world. The sun
had just dropped behind the distant spires and
tree-tops of the village and on Mt. Grafton, the
sugar-loaf hill behind the school, its last rays
rested on the spindley observatory crowning the
rocky summit. The campus was fast filling with
shadows, and along the streets and walks the
lamps made lemon-yellow points in the purple
dusk. In Manning and Trow and Lothrop lights
glowed wanly at the entrances, but School Hall
and the gymnasium were dark. Doubtless there
were lights, too, in the Principal’s residence, far
to the right, but the clustering maples hid all of
that but the roof. A faint breeze fluttered from
the southwest, but the evening was still oppressively
hot. By twos and threes and in larger
groups the fellows wandered away, some turning
their steps toward the village, a half-mile distant,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
others seeking the dormitories. Bert, Nick and
Ted, however, still loitered on the steps of Morris,
waiting for the moon to rise, and with them
loitered Pop Driver.</p>

<p>“It’s frightfully hot over in my room,” observed
the latter, sprawling his big form over the
steps. “I’m on the wrong side of the building
tonight.”</p>

<p>Bert prodded Nick with his foot. “Guess I’ll
bunk in with you, old man,” he said.</p>

<p>“You’ll bunk on the window-seat, then. Why
don’t you sleep in one of the rooms across the
hall? No one would care.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I will. Where’s that moon? Coming
along with us, Pop?”</p>

<p>“I guess so. I’d like to stay in the water all
night.”</p>

<p>“There’s the moon now, isn’t it?” asked Ted
lazily.</p>

<p>“Someone lighted up in Fuller,” replied Bert.
“Let’s go along down. We don’t have to have
the moon, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“It’s a lot more fun,” said Nick drowsily, settling
back against Bert’s knees. “Say, fellows,
isn’t it nice that school begins day after tomorrow?
Aren’t you all tickled to death?”</p>

<p>“Let’s not talk about it,” yawned Pop.</p>

<p>“No, come on and get that swim,” agreed Ted,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
getting to his feet and ungently tousling Bert’s
hair. “If we wait for the moon we never will
get in. And I’m hot and uncomfortable
and——”</p>

<p>“Something’s happened to the moon,” murmured
Nick. “Probably got a hot-box.”</p>

<p>“What about towels?” Bert got up, letting
Nick subside violently against the steps.</p>

<p>“We can dry off on the float,” said Ted.
“Come on. All in!”</p>

<p>Nick, rubbing the back of his head, arose with
groans and protests and draped himself against
Pop Driver.</p>

<p>“Nick wants to be carried,” he whimpered.
“Pop, please carry Nick. He’s so ’ittle!”</p>

<p>Pop complacently gathered the other in his
big arms and bore him away around the corner
of the house, Nick babbling nonsense. “Pop
likes to carry his ’ittle Nick, doesn’t he? Pop
loves his ’ittle Nick.”</p>

<p>“Pop loves him to death,” grunted Pop, depositing
him suddenly in a barberry hedge.
There arose a piercing wail from Nick as he
came into contact with the thorns, the sound of
cracking shrubbery and the thud of Pop’s feet
as he hurried off into the darkness.</p>

<p>“Oh, you big brute!” shouted Nick. “You
wait till I get hold of you! I’m full of stickers!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
Which way did that big, ugly hippopotamus go,
Ted?”</p>

<p>“Straight on into the engulfing gloom,” answered
Bert. “Look out for that clothes-line,
Nick.”</p>

<p>“Pop!” called Nick sweetly. “Pop, come back
to me, darling! Honest, Pop, I haven’t a thing
in my hands! I just want to love you!”</p>

<p>“I’m busy,” responded Pop from the darkness
ahead. “I got some of those old thorns myself.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Pop, I’m <em>so</em> sorry! Do they hurt, Pop?
Come back here and let me drive them in for
you!”</p>

<p>Peace was restored by the time they were passing
the tennis courts. Eastward, above the trees
beyond the little river, a silvery radiance heralded
the moon. They skirted the running track
and made their way to where, dimly, the dark
form of the boathouse loomed ahead of them.
When they reached it Pop experimentally tried
all the doors, but found them fast. They disrobed
in the shadow of the building and then,
making certain that there were no passers on the
road, a few rods distant, they raced down the
float and plunged into the water with whoops of
glee. When their heads emerged the moon had
topped the trees and, save where the shadow of
the covered bridge lay across it, the stream was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
bathed in silver. The water was warm, but far
cooler than the air, and Pop grunted ecstatically
as he rolled over on his back and floated lazily,
blinking at the moon. It was then that Nick obtained
his revenge. Sinking very quietly, he
swam across under water, emerged behind the unsuspecting
Pop, and—</p>

<p>“<em>Glug-gug-gug!</em>” observed Pop, as his head
went suddenly under and his feet flashed white in
the radiance. When he arose again, sputtering
and gasping, Nick was far across the stream, paddling
gently and crooning a little song.</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“There was an old man and his name was Pop.</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">His head went down and his feet went up!”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Stirring moments then, ending in the terrestrial
flight of Nick, Pop begging him to come
back and be drowned! Finally they all gathered
under the bridge and lolled on a crosspiece and
dabbled their legs in the cool water and talked.
Once a team went past overhead, and once an
automobile sped across, roaring fearsomely and
threatening to bring the old structure down on
top of them. Then quiet again, and the winding
stretch of the river below, black and silver. With
the rising of the moon the little breeze had found
courage and now blew cooler from the west. Nine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
o’clock struck in the village and they splashed back
into the water and swam to the float. Half an
hour later they parted in front of Trow, Ted and
Pop turning in there and Bert and Nick going
on to Lothrop.</p>

<p>Nick turned off at the top of the second flight
and Bert continued to his room. But when he
had donned pajamas the latter descended again,
the slate steps gratefully cool to his bare feet,
and he and Nick stretched out on the window-seat
and talked while the breeze blew past them
and softly rustled the papers on the table. Ten
o’clock struck. The conversation became fitful.
Once Nick snored frankly and then jerked himself
awake again, and replied brightly to an observation
of Bert’s made five minutes before.
Through the window they could look for nearly
a mile over fields and tree-bordered roads. A
little way off the buildings of a small farm were
clustered about the black shadows of a group of
elms. Beyond that two streaks of silver glittered
where the moon glinted on the railroad tracks.
Bert wondered if, after all, the view from this
side of the building was not more attractive than
that from the front, wondered what sort of a
chap this new roommate of his would turn out to
be, wondered if he had not taken a pretty big
chance in accepting him sight-unseen, wondered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
why Nick didn’t wake himself up with his own
snoring, wondered—</p>

<p>Some time in the early morning he disentangled
himself from the encumbering Nick and groped
his way down to his own room. He didn’t remember
much about it afterwards, though.</p>

<p class="cap">Bert, for one, found himself at a loose end
the next morning. He lingered as long
as possible over breakfast, but the day
promised to be even hotter than the one before,
and his appetite was soon satisfied. He and Nick
sat for a while in the shade of the trees near the
middle gate, but the heat soon drove them indoors,
and Bert climbed up to Number 29 and
unenthusiastically wrenched the lid from the packing
case there and set about the distribution of the
contents. The few pictures were deposited
against a wall, since it was best to see what his
roommate was bringing before deciding as to the
disposition of them. His books he found place
for and he laid some extra clothing in the dresser
drawers in the bedroom on the right. He had
selected that room in preference to the one on
the other side since Lothrop stood at right angles
to the other buildings in the row and from
“29b” one had an uninterrupted view along the
fronts of Trow, School and Manning. Only the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
gymnasium, hiding behind the shoulder of the
last dormitory, was out of sight. From the other
bedroom, “29a,” much of this view was cut off
by a corner of Trow, and Bert acted on the basis
of “first come, first served.”</p>

<p>The study was a good-sized square room,
lighted by two windows set in a dormer, beneath
which was a wide and comfortable seat. A bright-hued
rug occupied the center of the floor and the
walls were papered attractively to the height of
the picture molding in tones of golden-brown.
Above the molding was a foot of white plaster,
and two plastered beams ran the length of the
ceiling. The furniture was of brown mission;
two study desks, a table in the center of the room,
a Morris chair upholstered in brown leather beside
it, two armchairs, two sidechairs, and a settle.
The desks were supplied with green-shaded
droplights.</p>

<p>The bedrooms were identical. Each had a
single dormer window. Blue two-tone paper covered
the walls and a rug flanked the single white
iron bed. A dresser, a washstand and a chair
completed the furnishings. There was generous
closet room.</p>

<p>Bert was glad when Nick came in at eleven and
gave him an excuse for stopping his half-hearted
labors. Nick was down to a pair of soiled flannel<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
trousers, supported by a most disreputable
leather strap that scarcely deserved the name of
belt, a white tennis shirt, open at the throat, and
a pair of brown canvas “sneakers.” And he
looked as though he thought he still had far too
much on as he stretched himself out on the window-seat,
sprawled one foot over the edge, and
hung the other across the sill.</p>

<p>“Four or five fellows came a while ago,” he
announced. “Leddy and Ayer and some others.
Hairwig, too. Hairwig looks like he’d been sitting
in the sun all summer. Tanned to beat the
band.”</p>

<p>Hairwig’s real name was Helwig, and he was
instructor in physics and chemistry. Being a German,
the boys had at first called him Herr Helwig,
and later had shortened it to Hairwig. The
news of his advent didn’t, however, greatly interest
Bert, who inquired:</p>

<p>“Any of our masters shown up?”</p>

<p>“Haven’t seen any. I told you, didn’t I, that
I ran across Smiles in New York one day? He
was all dolled up. Said he was going out west
somewhere to teach at a summer school. He
seemed real glad to see me, too. Smiles is a
good old sport.”</p>

<p>“He isn’t old.”</p>

<p>“N-no, but Latin instructors always seem old.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
They know so plaguey much! Who do you think
will be proctor up here this year?”</p>

<p>“Cathcart, I suppose. He’s the only senior
on the floor. Wonder if we’re going to have a
big junior class.”</p>

<p>“Whopping, I heard; eighty-something. Know
anyone coming up?”</p>

<p>Bert shook his head. “No, and I’m glad I
don’t. You always have to look after them, and
they’re nuisances.”</p>

<p>“You’ll have to do the guide and mentor act
for your friend Ordway,” reminded Nick, with
a malicious grin. “Did you say he was an upper
middler?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I’d hate to enter a school in the middle like
that,” reflected Nick. “I should think it would
be hard.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see why.”</p>

<p>“Well, you don’t know anyone, in the first
place. It would take most of the year to get
acquainted, and then you’d only have one year
left. Going to put him up for Lit?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so, if he wants me to. You have
to do that much for a roommate, I guess.”</p>

<p>“When’s he coming?”</p>

<p>“Don’t know and don’t care. Want to buy
a good racket?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span></p>

<p>“How much?”</p>

<p>“Dollar and a half.”</p>

<p>Nick accepted the proffered article and viewed
it dubiously.</p>

<p>“I’d have to have it restrung.”</p>

<p>“Why would you? There’s only one string
gone. Take it along and try it.”</p>

<p>“Give you a dollar.”</p>

<p>“I guess you would! It cost seven. Hand it
over here, you Shylock.”</p>

<p>“Dollar and a quarter, then.”</p>

<p>“Cash?”</p>

<p>“Dollar down and the balance——”</p>

<p>“Some time?”</p>

<p>“No, next month; honest.”</p>

<p>“All right, but you’re getting it dirt cheap.
Where’s the dollar?”</p>

<p>“Downstairs. You don’t think I carry all that
money around with me, do you?”</p>

<p>“All right, but we’ll stop in for it before you
forget it. Are you really going over to the
Junction to meet Guy?”</p>

<p>“Surest thing you know! Want to come
along?”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t make the trip on that hot, dusty
old train for a thousand dollars!”</p>

<p>“You ought to, though. You ought to go over
and meet your new chum.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span></p>

<p>Bert grunted. “I’m likely to! I’ve been wondering
if he will bring any pictures and truck
like that. I hope, if he does, he won’t have the
usual rot. This is too good a study to fill up
with chromos. Something tells me, Nick, that
I’m an awful idiot to go in with some fellow I’ve
never seen. Bet you anything he will be a fresh
kid.”</p>

<p>Nick chuckled. “I decline the wager, Bert.
Also, I agree with you that you’re taking a chance.
Still, you can’t tell. Where does he come from?”</p>

<p>“Somewhere in Maryland.”</p>

<p>“Baltimore? I knew a fellow who lived in Baltimore,
and he was a crackajack.”</p>

<p>“No, some place I never heard of. I forget it
now. I suppose that makes him a Southerner,
doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Of course. Anything against Southerners?”</p>

<p>“No, only they’re a bit stuck up. If he tries it
with me I’ll shut him up mighty quick!”</p>

<p>“Bert, your disposition is entirely ruined. I
guess it’s the weather. I’m glad I’m not What’s-his-name,
Ordway.”</p>

<p>“If you’d had the decency to come in with
me——”</p>

<p>“Don’t blame me, old scout. Write to dad
about it. I wanted to, all right. Put something
on and let’s do something.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span></p>

<p>“What is there to do?”</p>

<p>“I’ll play you a set of tennis. It won’t be bad
if we take it easily.”</p>

<p>“Tennis! I see myself racing around a court
a day like this! How hot is it, anyway?”</p>

<p>“About two hundred in the shade. Then why
stay in the shade? Say, Bert, what sort of a captain
is Ted going to make?”</p>

<p>“Good.”</p>

<p>“I wonder!”</p>

<p>“Don’t see why not. He’s popular, and he’s
a good player——”</p>

<p>“Yes, but he isn’t awfully—oh, you know what
I mean; he isn’t exactly brilliant, eh?”</p>

<p>“He doesn’t need to be. Bonner will look after
that part of it.”</p>

<p>“Well, I never saw any sparks flying from Bonner,
for that matter,” returned Nick dryly.</p>

<p>“What’s the good of being brilliant, as you call
it? In football, I mean. It’s knowledge of the
game that does the business. And Bonner certainly
knows football; and so does Ted.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s so. All right. We’ll hope for
the best. Come on down and I’ll find that old dollar.
Then we’ll go over and see Leddy. He’s
probably trying to unpack, and he oughtn’t to do
it in this weather.”</p>

<p>They managed to kill time until luncheon was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
served in Manning, and after that they joined
a crowd in the common room there and remained
until it was time for Nick to go to the station to
take the train for Needham Junction. Mr. Russell,
Greek instructor, having arrived, Bert went
over to Trow to consult him about his new work.
Greek had been hard sledding for Bert the year
before and he viewed the first four books of Hellenica
with misgiving. The consultation in the
master’s study in Trow took up the better part of
a half hour, for “J. P.,” as Mr. Russell was
called, was not to be hurried. When he finally
got away Bert climbed up to Pop Driver’s room
on the floor above and found Ted Trafford and
Roy Dresser in possession. Roy was Pop’s roommate.
Pop, he explained, had gone to the village
to buy some lemons. They had drawn lots and
Pop had lost. If he didn’t die of sunstroke before
he got back there was going to be a lemonade of
magnificence. Bert decided to wait around.</p>

<p>But Pop tarried and after awhile Ted discovered
that it was after four o’clock and hurried
out. They could hear him taking the stairs three
at a time. Bert abandoned hope of that lemonade
and followed Ted, Roy Dresser apologizing for
Pop and adding that if Bert would keep his ears
open he, Roy, would yell across when the lemons
arrived.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span></p>

<p>It seemed a trifle cooler in the campus and the
shadow of Lothrop stretched far along the red
brick walk that ran, the main artery of travel,
along the fronts of the buildings. A locomotive
shrieked despairingly a mile or so away and Bert
knew that the first of the two trains on which the
bulk of the returning students would arrive was
nearing the station. Again his thoughts reverted
to Ordway and again he wondered pessimistically
what sort of a youth fate was going to impose
upon him. Ordway might not come until six-thirty,
however; many fellows didn’t; and Bert
rather hoped he would be of their number. He
was disposed to postpone the inevitable.</p>

<p>The rooms in Lothrop had been thrown open,
doors and windows alike, and the corridors were
far cooler than they had been since he had taken
possession of Number 29. Quite a draft of air
was blowing down the staircase well. In the
study, he put away the last few belongings, placed
the packing-case outside for removal to the store-room,
and finally, lowering the shades at the
windows through which the afternoon sun was
shining hotly, took up his schedule and, stretching
himself on the window-seat, studied it dubiously.
Mathematics 4, Greek 3, English 4, French 1,
History 3a; eighteen hours altogether, aside from
Physical Training. From the latter, however, he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
was exempt so long as he was in training with the
football team. Eighteen hours was the least required
for the third year, and he was expected to
select another study. He mentally pondered the
respective merits of physics and chemistry. Physics
was known as a “snap course,” but Bert was in
favor of leaving it for his senior year. The same
with chemistry. He rather leaned toward German,
but Mr. Teschner, or “Jules,” as he was usually
called, was a hard taskmaster and his classes
were not viewed with much enthusiasm. Still,
unless he took physics or chemistry it would have
to be German, and after a few minutes of cogitation
he wrote German 1 on the card in his hand.
The schedule had yet to be approved and he wondered
whether he would be allowed to go in so
heavily for languages. The schedule was a bit
top-heavy in that way, with thirteen hours of the
twenty-one given to Greek, German, and French.
Probably they would make him substitute physics
for German. He slipped the card in his pocket,
with a sigh for the vexations of life, and became
aware that Lothrop Hall was at last inhabited.
Steps scuffed on the stairs, voices sounded, bags
and trunks thumped. The invasion had begun in
earnest. Half inclined to go down and see if
Guy Murtha had arrived, he nevertheless found
himself too lazy to stir and so when, a few moments<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
later, footsteps drew near the open door
he was still sprawled on his back.</p>

<p>“This must be it, Bowles,” said a voice. “Yes,
twenty-nine. Oh, I beg your pardon!”</p>

<p>Bert sat up and slid his feet to the floor. In
the doorway stood a slim, pleasant-faced youth,
and behind him a very serious-looking man held
an extremely large kit-bag, an umbrella, and a
folded gray overcoat. The youth advanced
toward Bert, smiling and removing a gray glove.</p>

<p>“I fancy you are Winslow,” he said. “<a href="#i_fp038">I’m
Ordway.</a> I believe we share these quarters, eh?”</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_fp038">
  <img src="images/i_fp038.jpg" alt="" title="" />
  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><a href="#Page_39">“‘I’m Ordway.’”</a></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Bert shook hands. “Glad to know you,” he
replied. “Beastly hot, isn’t it? That’s your room
over there.” He glanced inquiringly at the second
arrival who, still holding his burdens, had
paused just inside the door. But if he looked for
an introduction none was forthcoming. Ordway,
who had now removed both gloves and tossed
them nonchalantly to the table, evidently had no
thought of making his companion known.</p>

<p>“Ripping view from here,” he said, glancing
from the window. Then, turning: “In there,
Bowles,” he directed, and nodded toward the open
door of the bedroom. “Just dump them, will you?
I’ll look after them myself.”</p>

<p>Bag and coat and umbrella disappeared, Bert’s
gaze following their bearer curiously. Ordway<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
had thrust his hands in his pockets and was
leisurely examining the study. His manner was a
queer mixture of quiet assurance and diffidence.
When he had shaken hands he had reddened
perceptibly, but now he was looking the place
over just as though, as Bert silently told himself,
he had ordered the whole thing. “I like
this,” he said, after a moment. “Rather jolly,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p>Bert was spared a reply, for just then the mysterious
Bowles appeared in the bedroom doorway.
“Shan’t I unpack the bag, sir?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No, never mind it, thanks.” Ordway consulted
a watch. “I fancy you’d better beat it, Bowles.
Your train leaves in fifteen minutes, you know.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, but there’s another one, sir, a bit
later.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure of that?” Ordway glanced inquiringly
at Bert. “He’s wrong, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes, the next one doesn’t go until seven-five.
If he wants to get this one he will have to hustle.
It’s a good ten minutes’ walk to the station.”</p>

<p>“Thanks. This gentleman’s right, Bowles.
You’d better start along. You know your way,
eh? Tell mother I’m quite all right; everything’s
very jolly.” The boy walked to the door with the
man and pulled a leather purse from his pocket.
“Better treat yourself to a bit of a jinks when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
you get to town. You’ll have four hours to wait,
you know. Good-by, Bowles.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Master Hugh. Good-by, sir. I
hung the coat in the closet, sir, and the keys are
on the dresser.”</p>

<p>“Right, Bowles. Now beat it or you’ll miss
that train. Good-by.”</p>

<p>Ordway sauntered back to the study, smiling.
“Bowles always gets time-tables twisted,” he
chuckled. “Rum chap that way. Bet you anything
you like he will miss that train.”</p>

<p>“He’s got twelve minutes,” said Bert. “Is he
a—a servant?”</p>

<p>“Bowles? Yes, he’s been looking after me ever
since I was out of the nursery. He’s a little bit
of all right, Bowles.” Ordway seated himself on
the farther end of the seat, looked interestedly
about the campus, no longer silent and empty, and
finally turned his gaze to Bert. Again the color
crept into his cheeks and he said diffidently, almost
stammeringly:</p>

<p>“I say, Winslow, I hope you’re going to like
me, you know.”</p>

</div>


<p class="cap">Half an hour later, having left his new
roommate to the business of unpacking
his trunk, Bert was in Number 12, and
he and Nick and Guy Murtha, their host, were
talking it over.</p>

<p>“We saw him on the train just after we left
the city,” Guy was saying. “Some of us had been
in the diner and when we came back through the
parlor car we saw this chap and the man with
him. They had a table and the kid was eating a
lunch out of a box and the chap in the derby hat
was waiting on him, or, anyway, that’s how it
looked. He’d take a sandwich out of the box
and put it on the kid’s plate and then he’d move
the mustard nearer and sort of fuss over the table.
He wasn’t eating a thing himself. I suppose he
ate at second table!”</p>

<p>Guy was a tall fellow of eighteen, a senior and
captain of the nine. He was not a handsome
youth; rather plain, in fact; but he had so many
likable qualities that one soon forgot that his nose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
was short and broad, that his heavy eyebrows met
above it, that his mouth was large and somewhat
loose and that his pale eyes, of a washed-out blue,
were too small. He had a jolly laugh and a pleasant,
deep voice that won friends.</p>

<p>Nick chuckled. “When they got off at the
Junction the man got confused and tried to get
back on the express again, and your friend stood
in the middle of the platform, with his hands in
his pockets, and shouted: ‘Bowles, you silly ass,
came back here!’ Everyone laughed like the
dickens.”</p>

<p>“He’s English,” said Bert dismally.</p>

<p>“Bowles? Rawther!”</p>

<p>“Ordway, too. I asked him. He was born in
England; I forget where; is there a place called
Pants?”</p>

<p>“Not in England, dear boy,” remonstrated
Nick. “It would be Trousers.”</p>

<p>“Hants, you mean,” said Guy. “Somewhere in
the south of England.”</p>

<p>“That’s it, Hants. His father is English, he
says, and his mother American. They live in
Maryland now.”</p>

<p>“Nice-looking chap,” said Guy.</p>

<p>Bert nodded. “Yes,” he agreed doubtfully.
“Yes, he’s a nice-looking kid, but——” His voice
dwindled to silence. Nick laughed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span></p>

<p>“Cheer up, old scout! He can’t be awfully
British if he has an American mama and lives in
‘Maryland, my Maryland.’ Bet you the sodas he
will be singing ‘Dixie’ when you get back!”</p>

<p>“More likely ‘Rule Britannia’ or ‘God Save
the King,’” replied Bert ruefully. After a moment:
“He’s got awfully smooth manners,” he
added grudgingly. “Makes me feel like a—an
Indian.”</p>

<p>“Wish he might have kept Bowles here with
him,” said Nick regretfully. “It would have
given Lothrop a lot of class!”</p>

<p>“I liked what I saw of him,” said Guy, “and I
guess you’ll take to him when you know him better,
Bert. Anyway, he’s a gentleman. You might
have been saddled with a regular mucker, you
know. We get one now and then.”</p>

<p>“Stop looking at me,” said Nick.</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s a gentleman, all right,” laughed Bert.
“That’s the trouble. I’ve got to live up to him,
don’t you see? I dare say he will put on a dinner
jacket and stuff his handkerchief up his sleeve.
He makes me feel like an awfully rough, uncivilized
sort of fellow.”</p>

<p>“Does he wear a wrist watch?” asked Nick.</p>

<p>“No, he has it on a fob. And, say, fellows, if
you want to see some swell things, come up and
give his dresser the once-over! Solid silver everything!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
Crest, too. Oh, we’re going to be pretty
classy in 29 this year, I can tell you!” And Bert
sighed.</p>

<p>“I’ll have to look up my crest,” observed Nick
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Your crest!” jeered Bert.</p>

<p>“That’s what I said. I’ve got a peachy one.
Dad had someone make it for him and put it on
the automobile doors. It was the proper caper
that year to have your crest on your auto, and
Dad doesn’t let anyone put anything over on him.
I told him I thought a cake of soap, rampant, surrounded
by the motto, ‘Won’t dry the skin,’ would
be rather appropriate, but he didn’t like it. Dad
makes soap, you know.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do know,” replied Guy. “I tried some
of it once. And it didn’t dry the skin, either. It
took it off.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’re not supposed to wash your hands
with laundry soap,” said Nick. “Of course, if
you’re used to that sort, though, and don’t know
any better——”</p>

<p>“I suppose,” said Guy gravely, “you’ll have to
sort of look after Ordway, Bert, now that he
hasn’t any valet; lay out his things in the morning,
you know, and put his studs in, and all that.”</p>

<p>“Fine!” approved Nick. “Maybe he will give
you a tip now and then. Say, did you pipe the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
gray suede gloves he wore? Think of gloves on
a day like this! Still, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">noblesse oblige</i>, eh, what?”</p>

<p>“I noticed the stunning Norfolk suit he wore,”
said Guy. “I’ll bet that wasn’t cut out by any
village tailor down in Maryland.”</p>

<p>“Rawther not!” drawled Nick. “I fawncy he
goes across every year and gets togged out in
Bond Street. What ho, old top!”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess I’ll go back and pilot him down
to supper,” said Bert. “Mind if I bring him down
here afterwards, Guy? Or, say, you fellows come
up, will you? I—I sort of funk the job of talking
up to his level all evening!”</p>

<p>“You bet we’ll come,” agreed Nick. “I want
to meet him. Something tells me that he and I
have a lot of mutual acquaintances amongst royalty
in dear old England.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t come up there and act the fool,”
warned Bert. “He’s new yet and not used to our
simple, democratic ways.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I won’t shock him,” chuckled Nick.
“Nothing like that, dear boy, ’pon honor. You’ll
see that he and I will get along like a house on
fire. Say, what’s his front name, the one you
take hold by?”</p>

<p>“Hugh,” answered Bert from the doorway,
“Hugh Brodwick Ordway. Some name, what?”</p>

<p>“Rawther!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span></p>

<p>“Cut it,” laughed Guy, “or we’ll all be talking
that way! I feel it coming on. We’ll come up
after supper, Bert, and help you entertain, although
when I’m going to get my things unpacked——”</p>

<p>“I’ll help you, Guy,” Nick volunteered. “I’m
a remarkable little unpacker. A misplace for
everything and everything misplaced, is my motto.
Bye-bye, Bert. Give my love to Broadway—I
should say Ordway. Tell him I’ll be around later
and cheer him up!”</p>

<p>Hugh Ordway was not, however, singing either
‘Dixie’ or anything else when Bert got back to
Number 29. He was sitting at the window, attired
principally in a bathrobe, gazing a trifle disconsolately,
or so Bert thought, out over the campus.
He turned as Bert entered.</p>

<p>“I say, Winslow, what about a bath?” he asked.
“Is there a tub on this floor?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but it’s five minutes to supper time, Ordway.
You’d better leave it till afterwards.”</p>

<p>The other reflected. “Very well,” he said.
“And, another thing.” He hesitated. “Do I put
on—er—do I dress, you know?”</p>

<p>“Well, I wouldn’t go down in that thing,” said
Bert gravely.</p>

<p>“No, but just regular things, eh? You see, I
really don’t know much about American prep<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
schools. I dare say I’ll make an awful ass of myself,”
he added ruefully.</p>

<p>“Wear whatever you like. Sweaters are the
only things barred. I’ll wait for you and show
you the way.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” was the grateful reply. “That’s decent
of you. I won’t be a minute.” He disappeared
into the bedroom and, judging from the
sounds, managed a very good substitute for that
prohibited bath. Still, although he wasn’t back
in a minute, Bert didn’t have long to wait. Ordway
returned in a blue serge suit and patent
leather shoes. He was certainly, thought Bert,
a mighty good-looking chap; straight, well formed,
with a clear, fair complexion, nice brown eyes and
hair of the same color. His nose was a bit aquiline
and his chin was at once round and strong
looking. Bert, studying him as he paused to make
certain that he had placed a handkerchief in his
pocket, decided that he was far more American
than English in appearance, whatever his character
might prove.</p>

<p>Bert moved to the door, while Ordway was securing
the missing article of attire, and pulled it
open. “All right?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, thanks.”</p>

<p>Bert unconsciously stepped aside for the other
to pass out first. Afterwards, going down the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
stairs, he was angry with himself for having
done so.</p>

<p>“I’m just as good as he is, for all his airs,” he
told himself, “and I’m the older, too.”</p>

<p>The big dining hall which ran across the north
end of the building and accommodated one hundred
students and faculty members at its fourteen
tables, was well filled when they entered. Bert
led Ordway toward the table at the far end of the
room at which he had sat last term only to find
that, in the confusion incident to the beginning of
school, all the seats there had been taken. There
were not two empty chairs together anywhere
near by and, in the end, Bert and Ordway were
obliged to sit at separate tables, the latter, as Bert
saw, being sandwiched in between Pop Driver and
a lower middle boy named Keller. Bert’s own
seat placed him amongst fellows whom he knew
only well enough to speak to, and he was frankly
bored and left the room as soon as he had satisfied
a not enthusiastic hunger. Ordway, however,
was still at table when Bert went out, and the latter,
desiring to accept Nate Leddy’s invitation to
go canoeing, nevertheless listened to the voice of
duty and waited in the corridor for his friend’s
appearance. Ordway came out finally and Bert
suggested that they take a stroll around the
grounds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span></p>

<p>“Did you get enough feed?” he asked politely.</p>

<p>“Yes, thanks. Awfully good chow, too, I
think.”</p>

<p>“Chow?” asked Bert.</p>

<p>“Food, I meant. I say, Winslow, I wish you’d
help me break myself of using—er—English expressions
like that, you know. I want to talk like
the rest of you chaps. Of course, I know a lot of
American slang now, but I don’t seem to always
get it in right, someway. Now what do you say
for ‘chow’?”</p>

<p>“‘Eats,’ I guess,” laughed Bert. “You’ll be
talking like the rest of us quick enough. Don’t
worry. Besides, what’s it matter?”</p>

<p>“Well, a chap doesn’t like to seem <em>different</em>, if
you know what I mean. And, anyway, I’m as
much American as English.”</p>

<p>“You’re not if you were born in England.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I say, Winslow, a chap can’t control that!
I might have been born in France, you know.
Fact is, I came rather near it! But that wouldn’t
have made me a Frenchie, eh?”</p>

<p>“No, but your father’s English and you were
born in England. That makes you a British citizen,
doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, but——” He paused. Then, confidentially:
“Fact is, Winslow, I’m awfully fond
of this country, don’t you know, and as long as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
I’m going to be here at Grafton two years I’d
like to—to be like the rest of you, if you know
what I mean. Of course, I <em>am</em> English. There’s
no getting around that. But my mother’s American
as anything. Her family has lived in Maryland
for a hundred and fifty years, I think it is,
and I always consider myself about half American,
too. On the other side, now, they’re always
taking me for a Yankee.”</p>

<p>Bert laughed. “They might on the other side,
but they wouldn’t here, Ordway! This is School
Hall. The recitation rooms and offices are on
the first two floors. On the third floor there’s
the assembly room where you attend chapel in the
morning and hear lectures and things. On the
floor above are the clubrooms: The Forum, the
Literary, the Glee, and the Banjo and Mandolin.
And the <cite>Campus</cite>, the monthly paper, has its
rooms there, too. The building beyond is Manning.
That’s where the juniors live. It’s about
like Lothrop, only it has ten more rooms.”</p>

<p>“The juniors live by themselves, eh? How
young are they?”</p>

<p>“Oh, we have ’em as young as twelve now and
then, but that’s unusual. They’re thirteen and
fourteen, mostly. The rooms downstairs on this
end are Jules’s. That’s Mr. Teschner, French and
German instructor. He and Mrs. Teschner have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
four rooms there, separate from the rest of the
hall. Then Mrs. Prouty, the matron, lives on
the floor above, just over them. ‘Mother Prouty,’
the fellows call her. Mr. Gring is on that floor,
and Mr. Sargent on the floor above. They call
Gring ‘Cupid’ and Sargent ‘Pete.’ All the faculty
have pet names. Doctor Duncan—that’s his cottage
there behind the trees—is ‘Charlie.’ Then
there’s ‘Nell’; you’ll have him in math; his name
is Nellis; and Mr. Smiley is called ‘Smiles,’ and
Mr. Gibbs is ‘Gusty,’ and Mr. Rumford is ‘Jimmy,’
and Mr. Russell is ‘J. P.,’ and so on.”</p>

<p>“I’ll have to learn them, won’t I?” asked Ordway
soberly. “That’s the gymnasium there, isn’t
it? I fancy it isn’t open, eh?”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe so.”</p>

<p>“I had a lot of fun in the summer looking at
the catalogue and wondering what things would
really be like. You know, you Americans
have——”</p>

<p>“‘You Americans’?” asked Bert quizzically.</p>

<p>Ordway laughed and colored. “I mean, <em>we</em>
Americans have a way of laying it on a bit thick,
if you know what I mean. Can’t always believe
all you read in the advertisements, you know.
That’s why I fancied this place might not be quite
up to specifications. It is, though. Everything’s
just about the way the catalogue gives it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span></p>

<p>“I guess so. Let’s go back to the room. That’s
about all there is to see. Except Morris and
Fuller over there. The two white houses at the
corner. They’re dormitories, too. Morris has
twelve fellows and Fuller eight. Some chaps like
them, but I never thought I’d care for them. It’s
getting a lot cooler, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, the breeze is bully. You’d say ‘bully,’
wouldn’t you?” he added doubtfully.</p>

<p>“I guess so,” laughed Bert. “Or ‘great,’ or
‘fine and dandy.’ What would you say?”</p>

<p>“Oh,” replied the other vaguely, “we might
say it was ‘ripping,’ or ‘topping,’ or ‘a little bit of
all right.’ ‘Bully’ wasn’t the word I meant,
though. It was——” He hesitated. Then,
“Corking!” he exclaimed triumphantly. “That’s
the word!”</p>

<p>“You’ll do,” Bert laughed. “Come on up.”</p>

<small>THE AWKWARD SQUAD</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">The school year began the next morning
at half past seven when the bell on School
Hall rang its imperative summons to
chapel. Hugh Ordway, sitting beside Bert in one
of the yellow settees in the back of assembly hall—precedent
gave the back seats to the upper-class
fellows at chapel and to the lower-class boys
at other times—observed everything with lively
interest. When, the short service over, the fellows
rustled back into their seats to listen to the
Principal’s talk, Bert whispered to Hugh: “You’d
better try for the Glee Club, old man, if you can
sing like that.”</p>

<p>Hugh flushed, but made no answer.</p>

<p>Doctor Duncan, middle-aged, tall, sallow,
bearded, and near-sighted, arose to the clapping
of hands and moved to the front of the platform.
His little speech was the same, almost word for
word, that the seniors had heard three times already,
but the juniors huddled in the front rows
listened with flattering attention and were, we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
will trust, properly impressed. The Principal’s
advice was excellent and they certainly couldn’t
do better than follow it. Then came a few announcements:
Mr. Gibbs had been detained at
home by illness and pending his return to duty his
classes in History would be taken by Mr. Gring;
German 1 would be held in Room F instead of H,
as formerly; seniors and upper middlers whose
courses had not been as yet approved would submit
them to Mr. Rumford during the morning;
the reception to students would be held that evening
at the Principal’s residence, and it was hoped
that all would attend.</p>

<p>Dr. Duncan bowed, removed his spectacles and
substituted his shell-rimmed glasses, and said,
“Dismissed,” and the hall emptied. Breakfast
was at eight o’clock and the first recitation period
was at nine. Neither Bert nor Hugh had a first-hour
class and they took advantage of that to
wait on Mr. Rumford, Assistant Principal and
instructor in history, with their schedules. Bert’s
misgivings proved not idle, for the German course
was changed to physics. Hugh had elected physics,
chemistry, and history in addition to the regular
studies for his year and his card was promptly
approved. At ten they went into Mathematics 4
together and at eleven they had Greek. In the
afternoon there were two more periods for Bert—French<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
and History, and one, the latter, for
Hugh.</p>

<p>They came out of Mr. Gring’s class together
and hurried to the room to leave their books and
change to football togs. Hugh, who had the evening
before announced his desire to play football
and been unblushingly encouraged by Nick, had
provided himself with a most complete supply of
clothing and paraphernalia, including a head-guard
and a football! He confessed that he
hadn’t been certain about the necessity for the
last article, but had decided to be on the safe
side. He looked remarkably spick-and-span in
his brand-new regalia when they sallied forth
again, a violent contrast to his companion, whose
togs were battle-scarred and weather-worn and
not, it must be confessed, overclean.</p>

<p>All Grafton, in togs or out, was flocking toward
Lothrop Field, and Hugh’s immaculate costume
was no longer spectacular once they had joined
the throng, since at least half the entering class
appeared to have donned football attire quite as
fresh and unsullied as his. The juniors were not
allowed to try for the School Team but, under the
direction of Mr. Sargent, Athletic Director, were
trained in the science of the game and later herded
into a first or second junior eleven and held
notable contests. Still later, the upper-middle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
and lower-middle classes formed teams and they
and the first juniors battled for the class championship,
a much-coveted prize.</p>

<p>Already a few tennis enthusiasts were busy on
the courts as Bert and his companion passed
through the gate, and Hugh stopped a moment to
watch. “I dare say a chap doesn’t have much
time for tennis if he plays football,” he remarked
questioningly.</p>

<p>“None at all,” said Bert. “Do you play?”</p>

<p>“A bit. It’s a rip—a corking game, I think.
If I don’t have any luck with football I’ll have
to go in for it. I saw a notice up about a Fall
Tournament, I think.”</p>

<p>“Yes, they have one in a week or two. We’ve
got some rather decent players here. Last year
we didn’t do a thing to Mount Morris.”</p>

<p>“You mean to say you beat them, eh?”</p>

<p>“We certainly did! They didn’t have a chance.
By the way, have you a racket?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes; thanks.”</p>

<p>“I sold a peach to Nick yesterday for a dollar
and a quarter. I was thinking maybe you might
have liked it.”</p>

<p>“That’s awfully good of you,” replied the other
gratefully, “but I’m fixed very well for rackets.
I brought three along.”</p>

<p>“Three! Then I guess you wouldn’t have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
needed that one. There’s your crowd over there,
Hugh. You wait with them, and Bonner will be
after you in a few minutes.”</p>

<p>“They’re the rookies, eh? Right, old chap.
See you later, then.”</p>

<p>What happened to Hugh that afternoon Bert
didn’t have much time to discover, for the regulars
had a pretty busy session. But afterwards,
back in 29, Hugh recounted his experiences with
a quiet drollery that brought many chuckles from
Bert.</p>

<p>“It was all rather different from what I’d
thought,” said Hugh, reflectively rubbing a sore
knee. “A chap named Hannigan——”</p>

<p>“Hanrihan,” corrected Bert. “Sub tackle.”</p>

<p>“Well, he took a lot of us over on the other side
of the tennis courts and made us do the most astonishing
things, do you know? We’d chuck the
ball around, one to another, and then when someone
would drop it, you know, instead of picking
it up he’d have to fall over on the wobbly thing!”
He rubbed his knee again. “I had to do it myself
a number of times. A bit awkward I felt, too.
The silly ball had a way of not being there when
you dropped down for it. And this chap Hanrihan
was most awfully impatient with us, do you
know? Some of the things he said were quite
rude. I fancy he didn’t mean anything, though. I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
dare say we were a bit trying. There was a fat
Johnnie with us who was always trying to catch
the ball in his mouth and, of course, his mouth
wasn’t big enough. Hannigan—I should say Hanrihan—told
me he was a tub of butter. Queer
thing to call him, I think. I wondered why a tub
of butter. Because he was fat, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes. You mustn’t mind what they say to you,
Hugh. It’s part of the game.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t. Of course, I understood that. Then
he had us line up and start off when he rolled the
ball and run like a ballywhack. But you’ve been
through with all that, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Not just what you expected, then?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll tell you, Bert. You see, on the other
side we don’t practise quite that way. I mean
we—well, we don’t—aren’t so serious about it,
if you know what I mean. Take rugger, for instance——”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon?” interrupted Bert, puzzled.</p>

<p>“Eh? Oh, rugger—Rugby, you know. We
rather make play of it. Of course, we do practise,
but not the way you American—I should say
<em>we</em> American—chaps do. But I dare say it isn’t
so hard when you’ve learned a bit, eh?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid it is,” replied Bert. “The more
you know and the better player you are the harder<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
grind you have to go through. If you make the
School Team you work like a slave for a good six
weeks.”</p>

<p>“Really? But what for?”</p>

<p>“Why to beat Mount Morris, of course. And
any others we can before that.”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course, but——” Hugh hesitated,
with a perplexed frown on his face. “Mind you,
I’ve seen football played, and I got beastly nervous
and excited about it, but what I’m trying to
get at is this, old chap: suppose, now, you didn’t
work so hard in getting ready for the other chap,
what would happen?”</p>

<p>“We’d get licked, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t like that, eh?”</p>

<p>“Like it? I should say not! Mount Morris
beat us last year, twelve to three, and this place
was like a—a morgue for a week afterwards.
This year we’re going to rub it into her.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I gathered,” said Hugh. “I
mean, those fellows I saw play last Autumn didn’t
seem to be having much sport, you know; didn’t
appear to be there for—for the fun they’d get out
of it, if you know what I mean. It looked to me
very much like hard work. The only time they
showed any pleasure was when they scored on
the other chaps. Then they’d wave their arms
and jump up and down like mad. And a thousand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
or so Johnnies in the seats would cheer themselves
hoarse. But that was ’varsity football, and
I fancied you fellows here at prep school would
go in more for the fun of it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we get plenty of fun out of it,” said Bert.
“We all like it, or we wouldn’t do it. That
is——” He hesitated. “Maybe some of us do
go in for football more for the glory than the
sport,” he went on thoughtfully. “I guess it’s
got to be rather a—a fashion. It’s like this,
Hugh. A fellow who makes his School Team is
a bit important and he gets some reputation and
fellows like to know him. And then, when he
goes up to college he finds it easier. If he keeps
on making good he meets fellows he wants to
know, fellows who can help him, you see, and he
probably makes one of the sophomore societies
and—there he is.”</p>

<p>“Yes?” said Hugh questioningly.</p>

<p>“I don’t mean that all the fellows who try for
the team think about all that. They don’t. Lots
of them play football because they love it. But
now, take Ted Trafford, for instance. Ted’s a
bully sort of a fellow, but he isn’t—well, brilliant.
Ted started out with the intention of doing just
what he has done, that is, being captain of the
team in his senior year. Ted’s going to Princeton
next fall. He will get there with the—the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
prestige of having captained the Grafton School
Football Team, and it’s going to be a lot easier
for him. If Ted went up there unknown he
would have hard work getting anywhere, probably.
He’s just a big, good-looking, good-natured
fellow, and he isn’t a smart student and he
wouldn’t shine at anything outside of football.
His folks aren’t wealthy, although I guess they
have enough money to live on, and they haven’t
any special social position in New York, I suppose.
But that won’t matter in Ted’s case because
he will go up there and make the freshman
team and then get on the ’varsity and make a name
for himself. He will meet fellows of money and
position that way, have a good time in college and
fall into something soft when he gets through.”</p>

<p>“I see,” said Hugh. “It’s that way to some
extent, I fancy, on the other side. I mean that if
a chap makes a name for himself at school he
finds it easier getting in when he goes up to Oxford
or Cambridge. It’s quite natural.” He was
silent a moment. Then: “I dare say that explains
why you chaps go in for sports so seriously.
You’re working for something, eh?”</p>

<p>“No, that isn’t quite right,” objected Bert. “I
didn’t mean you to think that every fellow has
that idea in his head. I guess more than half of
us take part in athletics because we want to. I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
know that in my case I never thought of getting
any advantages by it. In fact, I don’t believe I
ever thought the thing out before. I play football
just as I play tennis or hockey or anything
else, because I like the game, like mixing with a
lot of good fellows, like to do what I can for the
School.”</p>

<p>“And like to beat Mount Morris,” said Hugh,
smiling.</p>

<p>“You bet!”</p>

<p>“That’s the part of it that seems a bit odd,
now. As I make it out you don’t care so much
for playing football as you do for winning from
the other chap, the rival school, you know. If
you do win it’s all awfully jolly and everyone’s as
happy as a lark. If you lose, why, you all draw
long faces and feel sort of disgraced.”</p>

<p>“That’s rather exaggerated, but you get the
idea. And why not? Don’t you like to win when
you start out to?”</p>

<p>“Oh, rather! But playing a game is playing a
game, old chap. It isn’t business or war, is it?
Why not play for the fun of it? Try as hard as
you like and then if you don’t win—er—forget
it!” Hugh was palpably proud of his bit of
slang.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” replied Bert. “I’ve heard
a lot about your English sportsmanship and all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
that, but I notice that when we go over to your
side of the pond and beat you, you don’t like it a
bit and you come back at us with charges of professionalism.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know we did,” said Hugh. “If we
do, maybe it’s because you go into it so hard that—that
you look like professionals! You know
you do go a pretty long way sometimes to beat the
other chap.”</p>

<p>“Oh, rot! If you’re out to beat a fellow, beat
him. That’s my idea.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know, but there are some things a chap
wouldn’t do to win, aren’t there? He wouldn’t
cheat, for instance, and he wouldn’t take advantage
of—of technicalities, if you know what I
mean. Oh, I dare say I’ll come around to your
way of looking at it after a bit,” Hugh added
cheerfully. “Anyway, I’m going to keep on plugging
along at football, because, maybe, you know,
after a while I’ll really think it’s fun!”</p>

<p>“Meaning that you don’t now?” laughed Bert.</p>

<p>Hugh smiled and shook his head. “I’m afraid
I don’t—yet. Beastly grind, I’d call it now. I
say, isn’t it time for eats?”</p>

<small>“HIS GRACE, THE DUKE”</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Hugh Ordway was a success from the
start. Everyone who met him found
him interesting and attractive. They
didn’t put it in just that way. Nick said: “His
Grace, the Duke of Glyndestoke, is a little bit of
all-right.” Pop Driver said, “A clever lad, that
Ordway. Bring him over some evening, Bert.”
Tom Hanrihan said, “Ordway’s got the stuff in
him, Coach. He’ll bear watching. Doesn’t know
a thing about football, but he’s a regular wonder
at doing what he’s told to. Makes some of the
others over there look like regular bone-heads.”
Mr. Rumford, House Master at Lothrop Hall,
confided to Mrs. Rumford at dinner one evening
during the first week of school that “Ordway, in
29, is a most interesting boy, my dear. I wish
you’d remember to have him in for dinner some
Sunday. The fellow actually thinks for himself.”</p>

<p>Perhaps of equal importance, however, was
Bert’s verdict, since, willy-nilly, the two boys were
doomed to daily companionship. Bert’s verdict<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
was delivered to himself three days after Hugh’s
advent. “He’s a queer duffer, but I like him,”
said Bert. What was doubtless equally fortunate
was the fact that Bert’s liking was returned and
perhaps with more enthusiasm. Hugh had felt
rather strange, and, although he had tried not to
show it, a little bit homesick at first, and Bert,
more from a sense of duty than from affection at
that stage, had taken him under his wing and done
everything possible to make things easy for him.
As Nick had remarked, entering school in the
third year had its difficulties. Your classmates
had formed their associations and your position
was a good deal like that of a fifth hand at whist.
You were not especially needed, and, while welcome
enough to look on, there was no place for
you at the table. But Bert’s efforts, coupled with
Hugh’s personality, had succeeded, to continue the
metaphor, in squeezing the newcomer up to the
table. If at present Hugh was not actually taking
part in the game, at least he was where he could
enjoy seeing it. And for this Hugh was grateful.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, he had come to Grafton
with many misgivings. He had spent most of his
sixteen years in England, only coming across to
this country at long intervals and for brief stays.
At such times his mother’s house on the East
Shore in Maryland had been opened up for two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
or three months, infrequently for a longer period,
and Hugh had lived a life not greatly different
from his life in England. His father, a member
of Parliament, and holding a position under the
government, seldom accompanied them across.
Within the last three years Hugh’s visits in the
United States had occurred annually and had
lasted longer, for his mother, whose idea it was
to have Hugh educated in America, thought it
well for him to know the country better than he
did. Consequently, they had traveled a good deal
last year and the year before, accompanied invariably
by a tutor. That would not have been
an American youth’s notion of ideal sight-seeing,
but Hugh had been brought up with, first a governess,
and, subsequently, a tutor at his elbow, and
was thoroughly used to having them around.
Nevertheless, when, last year, the Balliol College
tutor had been left behind and a young, red-headed,
and extremely energetic graduate of Yale
had appeared at Shorefields and taken the boy in
charge, Hugh had welcomed the change.</p>

<p>That fall and during part of the following winter
Hugh had been coached for Grafton School.
He had, for instance, a far more mature outlook
but Mr. Fairway wouldn’t hear of it. Why waste
a year, he asked, when, with a little harder work,
he could enter the upper middle? Hugh, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
had no great enthusiasm for the program in any
case, agreed that to waste a year would be a criminal
matter and set diligently to work unlearning
not a little of what his English tutor had taught
him. When, in January, they had returned to
London he was pronounced ready for Grafton,
his name was entered for admission the next September
and he had contracted a certain amount of
pleasurable anticipation, most of which, however,
evaporated before he was once more headed
across the ocean in August. By that time a realization
of the fact that this New England preparatory
school for which he was booked was quite
dissimilar to any school of which he had knowledge,
that the fellows he would meet there were
different from him in manners and point of view,
that, in short, he was taking a plunge into a
strange pool filled with strange fishes, filled him
with alarm. That he managed to conceal any
sign of it was creditable. But he had found
the school not so different, after all, from those
he knew of, and the fellows were far less strange
in their ways, views and speech than he had expected.
Perhaps he did not actually give Bert
the credit for bringing all this about, but he did
somehow arrive at the conclusion that his roommate
had worked something in the nature of a
miracle in his behalf, and his gratitude, although<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
not expressed in words, was deep and evident.
Gratitude even when out of proportion to benefits
bestowed is pleasant to the recipient, and
doubtless the fact that Hugh was grateful and
wanted Bert to know it had something to do with
the latter’s liking for the younger boy.</p>

<p>That difference in age—it was in reality a matter
of eight months—was not greatly apparent.
In some ways Hugh seemed older than Bert.
He had expected to enter the lower-middle class,
on life and things in general. Bert sometimes
felt annoyingly young and thoughtless during their
discussions. Hugh had studied so many things
out that Bert had never even considered, and
studied them out, too, to a conclusion which, right
or wrong, was at least something to tie to. Bert’s
convictions were few and concerned matters close
at hand. Hugh’s had to do with the most extraordinary
things: American politics, the British
foreign policy, income taxation, home rule for
Ireland, back-court versus net play in tennis,
woman suffrage, the abolition of the stymie in
golf, fancy waistcoats, farming as a profession,
and many, many more. Once Bert asked curiously
if all English fellows bothered themselves
with as many things as Hugh did and failed to
get any information because Hugh forgot the
question in trying to establish himself as only a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
half-Englishman. (“Fifty-fifty,” suggested Bert,
which expression on being explained was seized on
joyfully by Hugh and added to his rapidly increasing
collection of slang phrases.)</p>

<p>Next to Bert, Hugh’s liking was given to Nick
Blake, and then to Pop Driver, and after that,
I suspect, to Guy Murtha. But Hugh had a fine
capacity for liking everyone he met, finding, often
to Bert’s amusement, qualities worthy of admiration
in the fellows whom Bert had long since set
down as utterly hopeless. Nick and Guy were
daily visitors at Number 29, and many quite remarkable
discussions took place up there under
the roof, discussions usually conducted principally
by Hugh and Guy, with Nick supplying a
light comedy seasoning and Bert acting the rôle
of audience and, generally, deciding the matter in
the end. For, although frequently Bert found the
argument too deep for him, he could sum up and
award a verdict like a judge of the Supreme
Court!</p>

<p>That study up there was a very attractive room
now. Hugh had not brought a great deal with
him in the way of pictures, but what he had
brought were interesting and, as Nick said, gave
tone. Bert’s wall decorations ran to “shingles”
and framed posters, although he was the proud
possessor of a good etching of sheep by Monks,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
and a rather jolly coaching print. Then there
was a six-foot silk banner of vivid scarlet, with
the word “Grafton” in gray letters, along one
wall, and a captured Mount Morris pennant,
green and white, and showing battle marks, over
the window-seat. The pillows were the usual
strange collections of all hues and styles, many
of them, of course, running to scarlet-and-gray.
Hugh’s contributions were photographs,
some quite large and all handsomely framed. The
one that produced the most interest on the part
of visitors was the picture of his home in England.
It was just like the baronial manors and
lordly castles you read about, Nick declared, and
when he got enormously rich he was going to buy
one just like it. It was a stone building, with
the stones set in a peculiarly haphazard fashion,
and it rambled over the best part of an acre, or
seemed to. There were turrets and battlements,
and much very orderly ivy, and the remains of
a moat, and many stately trees and a “front yard,”
as Nick called it, that looked like two or three
perfectly level golf links thrown into one! That
photograph was a never-ceasing source of joy to
Nick, and if he was there when a new visitor
arrived he always haled the latter up to
see it.</p>

<p>“Our ancestral home,” he would explain, to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
Hugh’s embarrassment, “Lockley Manor, Glyndestoke,
Hants, England, by Jove!”</p>

<p>There was a smaller photograph of the home
in Maryland, but that was less impressive and
more like what Nick had seen. The two or three
English country views interested him more.
“This,” he would inform the newcomer, “is a view
of the spinney back of the home farm. And here
we have the bridge at Glyndestoke, with the Old
Inn in the distance. Right there is where Ordway
catches his salmon for breakfast. Every
morning when it’s rainy enough he saunters down
that road there accompanied by the head gamekeeper
and two or three assistant gamekeepers
and a few dozen gillies and fishes up a salmon.
That is, he gets the salmon on the hook, but, bless
your simple heart, he doesn’t pull him in. Oh,
dear no! Rather not! I should say otherwise
and vastly to the contrary. That’s where the
first assistant gamekeeper has his innings, d’ye
see? The first assistant gamekeeper takes the
rod and plays the fish while the head gamekeeper
stands ready with the landing-net. It’s all very
simple, you see. Nothing irksome about it all.
Ordway seldom gets tired fishing. He——”</p>

<p>“Oh, I say, Nick, cut it out, like a good chap!”
Hugh would beg. “Stuff a pillow in his mouth,
someone, please!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span></p>

<p>Nick had various sobriquets for Hugh. Sometimes
he was “Your Grace,” sometimes “The
Duke of Glyndestoke,” sometimes just “’Ighness.”
Eventually, though, it was Nick who discovered
in the school catalogue, when that was
issued in October, that Hugh’s full name as there
set down was Hugh Oswald Brodwick Ordway,
and, in consequence of the initials, promptly
dubbed him “Hobo!”</p>

<p>Possibly it was its absolute incongruity that
made that nickname instantly popular. At all
events, while Hugh’s more intimate friends did
not ordinarily call him “Hobo,” others and the
school in general did. But that was later, when
Hugh, greatly to his surprise, found himself a
rather important person at Grafton.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in that first fortnight of the fall
term, Hugh was a very busy youth. He pegged
away unfalteringly at football and began to like
it, in spite of the drudgery. He weathered two
cuts in the squad and saw other fellows with far
more experience released to private life or their
class teams. When, the second Saturday after
the opening of the term, Grafton played the local
high school and won without trouble by the
score of 26–0, Hugh saw the game from the
stand, and, with Guy Murtha to elucidate obscure
points, enjoyed it vastly. High School presented<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
a team badly in need of practice and Grafton
ran rings about her and could have scored
at least twice more had Coach Bonner thought
fit to let her do so. But when the third period
was a few minutes old and the score was 20–0,
he began to send in second-string players, with
the result that Grafton’s offensive powers waned
perceptibly. One more touchdown was secured
against the opponent in the last few minutes of
the final period when Siedhof, who had substituted
Bert Winslow at left half, secured the ball after
High School had blocked Nate Leddy’s try-at-goal.
Siedhof picked the ball literally from a
High School forward’s hands and in some miraculous
manner swung around and dodged and feinted
his way through a crowded field and over six
white lines to a score. Leddy missed the goal
and play ended soon after. Grafton showed the
benefit of those ten days of ante-season practice
so long as her first-string men were in the line-up,
and, on the whole, coach, captain, players,
and supporters were well satisfied with the showing
made in that first contest.</p>

<p>Hugh gained more knowledge of the finer
points of football that evening when Nick, Pop
Driver, Guy and Bert threshed it all out in Number
29. Much of the discussion went over his
head, but he awoke to the realization that there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
was a great deal more to football than meets
the eyes of the spectator. Nick and Bert argued
for ten minutes over one play which had
gone awry. Bert declared that it shouldn’t have
been called for in the circumstances and Nick
proved, to his own satisfaction at least, that it
was fundamentally, psychologically, scientifically
correct. Whereupon Pop, who had listened without
comment, informed Nick that he was wrong.
And, for some reason, Nick and everyone else
accepted the dictum without question. Much
technical talk followed, and Hugh was soon beyond
his depth, but he tried hard to understand
and stored up a fine collection of questions to
ask Bert later.</p>

<p>But other interests besides football demanded
Hugh’s attention. He was nominated for election
to “Lit” by Bert and seconded by Nick and
Pop. The Literary Society and The Forum were
the rival social and debating clubs. Secret organizations
of any sort were tabooed at Grafton,
although there was, or was said to be, a certain
lower middle-class society known as “Thag”
which was supposed to exist in defiance of the
law. If it really existed outside the imaginations
of lower middlers it was of such slight consequence
that faculty winked at it. Hugh might
have been put up for The Forum instead of “Lit”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
had he wished, for Guy was an enthusiastic member
of the older club and did his best to get
Hugh’s permission to nominate him. Hugh,
though, with no real preference, felt that he ought
to allow Bert to decide the matter for him, and
Bert naturally claimed his chum for his own society.</p>

<p>Hugh was also elected, much less formally, to
the Canoe Club, and, at Bert’s urging, attended
several trials for the Glee Club, to which he was
eventually admitted. The elections to The Forum
and the Literary Society took place in January,
but candidates were meanwhile admitted to a
quasi-membership that gave them the use of the
club rooms and allowed them to attend meetings,
without participation in debates or affairs.</p>

<p>In the class rooms Hugh progressed well, for
the fiery-locked Mr. Fairway had done his work
thoroughly. In fact, Hugh began his career at
Grafton most satisfactorily, and progressed serenely
and pleasantly and without especial incident
along the stream of school life until, just
two weeks to a day after his arrival, he struck
his first snag.</p>

</div>


<p class="cap">It was the custom for the juniors to hold a
meeting shortly after the beginning of the
school year and elect class officials, and it
was also the custom of the lower middle and upper
middle fellows to take quite a flattering interest
in the affair. Perhaps it would be more
correct to say that the lower middlers were interested
in the meeting and the upper middlers
were interested in the lower middlers. Just why
the second-year boys held it incumbent to do all
in their power to prevent the juniors from getting
together successfully it is difficult to say;
but they did. The upper middlers’ part in the
proceedings was theoretically to see that the first-year
fellows had fair play, but what they actually
did was to have a good-natured mix-up with the
lower middlers. Consequently the evening of
junior meeting was looked forward to with pleasurable
anticipation by the whole school, unless
we omit a portion of the junior class whose disposition
was entirely peaceable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span></p>

<p>The juniors did their best to hold the meeting
in secret, but someone outside the class invariably
got wind of it in time to give the alarm.
Faculty had on one or two occasions, when the
fun had become rather too noisy, threatened to
prohibit the ceremony, but at the time of this story
it was still observed. This fall it was arranged
among the juniors that they were to meet at five
o’clock on Wednesday afternoon in assembly hall.
But the watchful lower middlers prevented that
by the simple expedient of locking both doors on
the inside and leaving the keys in, departing by
way of a window and by means of a rope. By
the time Mr. Crump, the head janitor, had pushed
out one of the keys and fitted a new one it was
too late for the meeting and the juniors retired
in defeat. Subsequently they allowed it to leak
out that the postponed assembly would take place
in the same room on Saturday evening, and, for
some reason, their story was believed.</p>

<p>But on Thursday evening at about eight o’clock
cries of “Lower middle, all out!” echoed through
the dormitories and books were abandoned and
green eye-shades tossed aside. In a few minutes
it became known that the juniors had stolen a
march and were safely barricaded in the gymnasium!
Lower middle hastened to the scene in
force, and upper middle followed swiftly. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
seniors, forgetting dignity, likewise repaired to
the gathering to play the part of spectators. As
Roy Dresser remarked to Ted Trafford as they
secured positions of vantage against the end wall
of Manning, it looked very much as though, in
the words of the country newspapers, “a good
time was to be had by all.”</p>

<p>Lower middle tried doors and windows and
found them impregnable. They were denied even
a glimpse of the proceedings inside, for the juniors
had carefully draped blankets against the
windows. Lower middle held a conference of war
and upper middle jeered. Upper middle not only
jeered but made remarks calculated to displease
the enemy. Lower middle replied in kind and
the seniors applauded both sides. And there the
matter would have rested until the juniors had
finished their meeting and sallied forth had not
an ambitious lower middler taken it into his head
to try to reach the second story by means of
a copper rain-spout. Why that should have annoyed
upper middle I don’t know, but upper middle
resented the trespass and surged forward.
The attack was so unexpected that lower middle
gave way and the ambitious climber was pulled,
struggling, from his place halfway up the metal
pipe. He reached the ranks of his friends no
worse for the adventure, but lower middle felt<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
that her rights had been interfered with and the
fun commenced.</p>

<p>Up and down in front of the gymnasium the
battle waged, the two classes fairly even in numbers.
For the first few minutes it was a mere
matter of pushing and shoving, one throng against
the other, lower middle giving way only to close
ranks again and force upper middle back. The
seniors, laughing and impartially encouraging the
belligerents, watched appreciatively. And in the
meanwhile, quite forgotten, the juniors proceeded
undisturbed with their election.</p>

<p>Afterwards lower middle declared that upper
middle had started the real trouble, and upper
middle stoutly laid the blame on her opponent.
At all events, what was to be expected happened
and someone, losing his temper for the instant,
struck a blow. His adversary accepted the challenge.
Others at once adopted the new tactics
and cries of “Fight! Fight!” arose from both
factions, and those behind surged eagerly forward.
At first it was only those in the front
ranks who became engaged, but the others soon
got into action and presently some ninety-odd
youths were hard at it. More than one old score
was settled, doubtless, in the ensuing five minutes.
The seniors, scattering away from the field of
battle, viewed proceedings dubiously. This was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
more than precedent called for, and if a master
happened to put in an appearance there would
be trouble for all concerned.</p>

<p>It was Ted Trafford and Joe Leslie, the latter
senior class president, who finally, calling
for volunteers, attempted to put an end to hostilities.
It was no easy task, however, for while
many of the belligerents were fighting for the
sheer love of it, keeping their tempers in check,
there were others who were mad clear through
and who had to be literally dragged apart. Pop
Driver performed lustily for the peace party, his
simple way of tripping up one adversary and holding
the other proving peculiarly efficacious. But
at that it is doubtful if the seniors could have
ended the battle for a long time if Guy Murtha,
who had intercepted a blow meant for someone
else and was ruefully nursing a bruised cheek, had
not hit on the expedient of raising the warning cry
of “<em>Faculty, fellows, faculty!</em>” Fortunately, there
was no truth in the announcement, but it did the
business. Panting for breath, upper and lower
middlers drew apart, searching the half-darkness
with anxious gaze, ready to disappear as soon as
they discovered from which direction danger
threatened. Leslie took advantage of the lull to
read the riot act and his words of counsel had
effect. Upper middle bitterly laid the onus on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
lower middle and lower middle indignantly returned
the charge.</p>

<p>“Never mind who started it,” said Leslie impatiently.
“You fellows beat it to your rooms
before you get caught. You’re a lot of silly idiots
to do a thing like this, anyway, and it would
serve you all right if you got what you deserve.
Hanrihan, you ought to know better than to let
this happen!”</p>

<p>“Someone jumped on me,” replied Tom Hanrihan
cheerfully. “I didn’t start it, Joe.”</p>

<p>“Well, get away from here before anything
happens. Come on, seniors.”</p>

<p>Nursing bruised faces and knuckles, holding
handkerchiefs to bleeding noses, the participants
in the recent fracas began to disperse, slowly,
however, since neither side wished to be the first
to withdraw. Still, the incident would have been
closed there and then had not the juniors seen
fit to throw open the gymnasium door at that
moment and burst triumphantly forth. That was
too much for the sore and smarting lower middlers
to endure with equanimity. There was a
murmur of displeasure and then a howl of rage
and the lower middlers surged up the steps and
literally crushed the juniors back through the portals.</p>

<p>“You like it so well in there you can stay<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
there!” they shouted. “It’s all night for you fellows!
You don’t get out! Keep ’em in, lower
middle!”</p>

<p>But that was not so easy, since there were
plenty of windows, and it didn’t take the juniors
long to remember the fact. The sight of figures
skulking away in the darkness soon apprised the
guardians of the portal of what was happening
and shouts of “Windows, fellows, windows!” was
heard and half their number left the portico to
intercept the escaping prisoners. That presented
upper middle with an excellent opportunity to
take a hand again and she seized it eagerly. In
a twinkling the doorway was cleared of lower
middlers and the juniors came forth. Lower middle,
resenting upper middle’s interference, again
rallied and tried to force the portico, only to be
thrice hurled back before superior numbers. As
occasion occurred, the juniors fled to the safety of
Manning, or tried to, for not a few were caught
and held prisoners by the enemy. Jeers and
taunts were exchanged, while the seniors once
more attempted to persuade the warring factions
to cease hostilities. Finally upper middlers and
such juniors as remained with them sallied down
the steps in force and the battle broke forth again.
It was a running fight now, for the juniors fled
helter skelter for the nearby dormitory, protected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
by upper middlers, while the lower middlers
tried to capture them. Confusion reigned supreme.</p>

<p>Hugh, who had taken part in the proceedings
with zest and had sustained a lump as large as a
bantam’s egg over one eye and a set of sore knuckles,
became separated from his friends somewhere
between Manning and School Hall. A
minute before he had been battling with Nick at
his side and his back against the rubbish barrel
at the corner, but now Nick had disappeared and
although the combat waged behind and before
him, he was alone and unchallenged. That,
thought Hugh, would never do. For the glory
of upper middle he must find an adversary. So
he raced down the bricks toward the steps of
School Hall, where he could discern under the
lamplight a group of fellows struggling strenuously.
He slowed up as he approached in order
to distinguish friend from foe, but, to his surprise,
someone pinioned his arms from behind
and he was thrust rudely into the group in front
of the door.</p>

<p>“Here’s another, fellows!” panted his captor.
“Get him!”</p>

<p>Before he knew it he was being forced up the
steps and through the door of School Hall, struggling
but helpless, someone holding his arms at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
his sides and someone’s hand gripped chokingly
about his neck. Down the corridor to the stairs,
up the stairs, along another corridor and, at last,
into a classroom. Then the uncomfortable grasp
on his neck was removed, the door slammed, a
key turned outside and Hugh, breathless and dizzy
but still unconquered, wheeled around with ready
fists.</p>

<p>The room, one of the smaller ones, was unlighted
save for what radiance came through the
window from the lamps along the path below, but
Hugh could see two other figures in the gloom and
he was eager for battle.</p>

<p>“Come on,” he challenged. “I’ll take you
both!”</p>

<p>“I—I don’t want to fight, thanks,” said a mild
voice from the darkness. “I—I——”</p>

<p>“Are you a junior?” asked the other occupant
of the gloom.</p>

<p>“No, are you?” replied Hugh.</p>

<p>“Yes, they collared me and Twining just as we
were coming around the corner. We climbed out
of a window in the gym and were trying to get
to Manning. Do you suppose they mean to keep
us here long?”</p>

<p>“So that’s it, eh?” mused Hugh. “I thought
you were upper middle fellows when I saw you
scuffling down there. Well, they’ve got us to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
rights, haven’t they?” He made his way to the
window, raised the lower sash and looked out.
Everything was quiet below, a fact explainable
by the unmistakable presence on the walk further
along near Manning of two masters in conference.
Hugh pulled his head in quickly for fear
they might look up and see him.</p>

<p>“They’ve all gone,” he announced to his fellow
prisoners, “and Mr. Smiley and one of the
other masters are down there.”</p>

<p>“Then if we call to them they’ll let us out,”
said the youth who wasn’t Twining.</p>

<p>“Yes, but——” Hugh thought a moment.
Then: “All right,” he agreed. But when he
put his head through the window again the masters
had disappeared. “They’ve gone now,” he
reported. “Try that door and see if it’s really
locked, one of you chaps.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is,” was the answer from Twining,
who had a thin, piping voice and sounded as
though he might be only about thirteen. “Don’t
you think they’ll come back pretty soon and let
us out?”</p>

<p>“I fancy so. They’ll wait until things quiet
down, I dare say. All we can do is wait.” Hugh
felt his way to a chair and seated himself and
the others followed his example. There was
silence for a minute or two during which Hugh<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
felt admiringly of the lump over his left eye.
Then Twining spoke with something like a sniffle.</p>

<p>“I don’t think it’s fair for them to do this,”
he complained. “We juniors have to be in by
nine o’clock and I guess it must be more than that
now, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Must be,” agreed Hugh. “Can’t you get in
without being seen?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied the other junior disgustedly.
“They lock the door about a quarter past and
you have to ring. We’ll get the dickens!”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s all in a lifetime,” returned Hugh
philosophically. “Anyway, you chaps held your
meeting. That ought to comfort you, eh?”</p>

<p>“I dare say, but it isn’t very nice to have to
spend the night up here.”</p>

<p>“That’s the idea,” exclaimed Hugh. “Stay up
here and they won’t know you weren’t in, will
they?”</p>

<p>They seemed doubtful about that. Twining
was of the opinion that Mr. Gring, who was master
on his floor, would somehow learn of his absence.
“He finds out everything, Cupid does,”
he sniffled. “Besides, I can’t sleep here in this
hard seat all night.”</p>

<p>“Try the floor then, old chap. That’s what I
shall do if they don’t come back and let us out.”</p>

<p>“But they will, of course,” said the other of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
the two. “They wouldn’t dare not to, would
they?”</p>

<p>“I really can’t——” Then Hugh amended his
answer. “Search me,” he said. They talked
desultorily for a while. Hugh learned that the
second and presumably older boy was named
Struthers. Struthers boasted of the junior class’s
success in pulling the meeting off and told how
he had put lower middle off the track by writing
a note to one of their members announcing the
affair for Saturday night and purposely dropping
it in the corridor of School Hall. Struthers
chuckled a lot about that, but Twining appeared
incapable of seeing humor in anything just now.
He was all for putting his head out the window
and calling for help, but Hugh vetoed that plan
and threatened to punch the first one who tried it.</p>

<p>“A silly-looking lot we’d be,” he said disgustedly,
“if the masters had to come up here and free
us! We’d be laughed at all over school. If they
don’t let us out pretty soon I’ll see if I can climb
around to the next window. It’s only about four
or five feet from this one, and if there’s anything
to hold on to I can do it.”</p>

<p>“You might fall and hurt yourself,” sniffed
Twining.</p>

<p>“I don’t think so. It isn’t far to the ground,
for that matter. If we could find a rope or something<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
I might be able to drop. Anyone got a
vesta?”</p>

<p>“A vest on?” asked Struthers. “No, but we
could tie our jackets together and——”</p>

<p>“I said a vesta, a match,” laughed Hugh.
“Tying our jackets together isn’t a bad idea,
though. If I can’t make it by the window——”</p>

<p>He stopped and listened. Ten o’clock was
sounding.</p>

<p>“Now we’ll all be hung together,” he said cheerfully.
“If I get caught coming in after ten I’ll
get ballywhack too. I’m going to have a look
at that window.”</p>

</div>


<p class="cap">Hugh thrust his body through the window
again. No one was in sight along
the front. By leaning well out he could
see the lighted windows of Number 29 Lothrop,
and he smiled as he reflected that Bert was probably
wondering what had become of his roommate.
Then he viewed the next window, some
five feet distant.</p>

<p>The sills were broad and extended a few inches
beyond the casements, but Hugh doubted that he
would be able to stretch his legs far enough to
reach, even could he find anything to hold on to.
He crawled out on the sill, to the alarm of the
hysterical Twining, and, while keeping a firm hold
of the window sash, felt about over the bricks in
search of some projection to cling to. In the end
he had to return to the classroom defeated. <a href="#i_fp092">That
avenue of escape was out of the question.</a> The
distance to the ground didn’t look far, but it must
be, he realized, about twenty feet, and that meant
a drop of fifteen feet, enough to shake one up<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
considerably. But by knotting their coats together
it might be done.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_fp092">

  <div class="caption">
    <p class="noic"><a href="#Page_90">“That avenue of escape was out of the question.”</a></p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>“Let me have your coats, fellows,” he said,
pulling his own off. They emptied the pockets
first, stowing the treasures away in their trousers,
and then handed the garments over. Hugh tied
the three sleeve to sleeve, testing each knot, but
when the task was completed the result was disappointing,
for the improvised rope measured
only about five feet in length, a portion of which
would have to remain across the sill and, since
there was nothing to tie it to, be held by the juniors.
Hugh studied a moment. Then he unbelted
his trousers.</p>

<p>“I don’t know how strong these things are,”
he said, “but I fancy they’ll stand the strain all
right.”</p>

<p>He made a pile of his pocket contents on the
floor and knotted the end of one leg to a sleeve
of a coat, adding another three feet to the length
of the whole.</p>

<p>“Now,” he said cheerfully, “you chaps lay hold
of this end, d’ye see? Pull it tight across the
sill and you won’t have any trouble. Better sit
down on the floor, the two of you, eh? That’s
the idea. If you happen to find you can’t hold
on, or the thing starts to rip, shout out to me so
I can drop. All right now?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span></p>

<p>“Y-yes,” replied Struthers doubtfully. “I hope
we can hold it!”</p>

<p>“So do I,” replied Hugh grimly as he squirmed
his body across the sill. “If you can’t I’ll get
down quicker than I fancy. Hold tight now. I’m
going to put my weight on it.”</p>

<p>There was a breathless moment of suspense,
a moment during which the garments made threatening
sounds of giving at the seams, and then
Hugh’s head disappeared from sight, the two boys
on the floor, feet braced against the wall, held
on for dear life and——</p>

<p>“All right!” called a cautious voice from outside.
There was a sound of a thud on the bricks
and the two juniors simultaneously toppled over
backwards.</p>

<p>There was one thing, though, which Hugh had
neglected to take into consideration, and that was
the probability of the door of School Hall being
locked. And when, a bit jarred but quite unhurt,
he climbed the steps and tried it, he realized
the fact, for the portal was fast. Flattening himself
against the door in the shadow, he wondered
how he had bettered the condition of his fellow
prisoners. They couldn’t follow him by the window,
of course, and he, it seemed, was unable to
unlock the door to the corridor for them! And,
to add interest to the situation, he was sensible<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
of being most unconventionally clad—or, rather,
unclad—and didn’t at all relish standing down
there in the light and calling up for his trousers
to be thrown to him! Meanwhile it was quite
within the possibilities that one of the masters
might come prowling past and find him!</p>

<p>But something had to be done, and the only
thing that occurred to him was to try the windows
in the hope of finding one unlatched. So,
making certain that no one was in sight, he scuttled
from his place of concealment and fled around
to the back of the building, where the possibility
of being observed at his burglarous task was not
so great. It was as dark as pitch back there, but
after waiting a minute to accustom his sight to
the gloom he was able to discern a window. The
sill was at the height of his chin and he wondered
whether, even if he was lucky enough to find one
unlatched, he could get through it.</p>

<p>The first resisted all his pushing and heaving,
and so with the second and third, but when he
thrust upward on the next the sash gave readily,
but with a fearsome screech that brought his
heart to his mouth. After waiting a moment
there in the darkness, however, he pushed the
window as high as he could reach and then set
about the next step. There was nothing to put his
feet on, but by getting his arms over the sill he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
finally managed to work his body up and was soon
inside.</p>

<p>The first thing he did was to walk squarely into
a desk, and after that it seemed to him hours before
he found the door into the corridor. Once
outside, his troubles were by no means over, for
when he had at last discovered the stairway and
descended the first flight he couldn’t think in which
direction the room he sought lay. He found it
at last, though, turned the key and entered to be
greeted by exclamations of mingled relief and
displeasure. It was Struthers who expressed relief,
and Twining who voiced displeasure.</p>

<p>“Seems to me you took your time,” said the latter.
“You must think it’s lots of fun waiting up
here——”</p>

<p>“Stow it!” interrupted Hugh, his temper not
improved by the adventures of the past ten minutes.
“It would serve you jolly right to make
you shin down the coats and trousers!”</p>

<p>Twining subsided to mutters and Hugh clothed
himself again and rescued his treasures from the
floor. When he had finished, the two juniors
were already outside.</p>

<p>“You can’t get out the door,” said Hugh. “It’s
locked. Keep with me and we’ll slip out a window
at the back.”</p>

<p>Twining again demurred, but Struthers promptly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
sat on him, and a minute later they were outside.</p>

<p>“Now you chaps see if you can find a window
unlocked. That’s what I’m going to do. I don’t
fancy having it known that I was locked up in
School Hall by a lot of fresh lower class chaps.
Good night.”</p>

<p>“Good night,” replied Struthers, “and much
obliged, Ordway.”</p>

<p>Twining, however, was already creeping off in
the darkness, wasting no time on amenities.
Hugh felt a strong desire to overtake the youngster
and cuff him, but in the end he only shrugged
his shoulders and considered his own plight. He
carefully closed the window before he turned
away to seek Lothrop, and when he did he kept
along at the back of Trow to avoid the lights in
front. It was well after ten o’clock now and most
of the windows were dark, but here and there a
light still shone. Mr. Russell’s study on the first
floor of Trow was illumined and the curtains were
raised, and as Hugh, bending low, passed beneath
them he fervently hoped that the Greek
master would not take it into his head to approach
a casement just then.</p>

<p>The ground floor of Lothrop was given over
to public rooms save where, at the farther end,
Mr. Rumford had his suite of five rooms and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
bath. Along the front, between the two entrances,
were the library, the common room and the recreation
room. At the back were rooms occupied
by the superintendent of buildings, Mr. Craig, and
by the head janitor, Mr. Crump, a store room and
a serving room. The nearer end of the building
was taken up by the big dining hall. There were
ten windows in the latter and Hugh hoped to find
one of the number unlatched. He kept away from
the front of the building, for it was disconcertingly
light there, and tried the first window on the
end. It was fast, however, and so was the next
one. Then, to his consternation, the ground began
to slope away to the level of the basement
floor at the rear of the building, for the kitchen
and laundry and various other service rooms were
above ground at the back. This brought the third
window almost head-high and placed the fourth
beyond his reach, and the third window was locked
as fast as the others!</p>

<p>He knew nothing of the lay of the land below-stairs
and feared to try his fortunes there. Consequently
there was nothing to do but risk detection
while trying the windows along the
front or to ring a door-bell and be reported by
Mr. Crump. He had little liking for either alternative
and hesitated a moment in the shadow
at the corner before emerging into the publicity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
of the walk which, while deserted, was in plain
view of Trow. After all, though, it was, he reflected,
no hanging matter, and so he presently
emerged quite boldly and, as he passed along the
front of the dormitory, tried each window. He
had progressed as far as the library when his
perseverance was at last rewarded. A sash gave
readily to his pressure and in a twinkling he was
inside.</p>

<p>Lights in the corridor shone through the open
doors and he had no trouble, after he had silently
closed the window again and fastened it, in making
his way between chairs and tables. At the
door nearest to the stairs he paused and looked
out. No one was in sight and he swiftly stepped
into the corridor, around the corner and through
the swinging door that gave on the stairs. He
stepped lightly, for he knew that on each floor
a master’s bedroom was separated from him by
only the thickness of a wall. It was when he
had reached the fourth floor and had his hand
on the door there that he recalled the fact that
directly across the hallway was Number 34, inhabited
by Cathcart. Cathcart was a proctor
and, so it was said, a most conscientious one.
He would have done better, as he now realized, to
have gained the floor by the other stairway. However,
Cathcart’s door was tightly closed and it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
was more than likely that Cathcart was sound
asleep. So Hugh pushed the swinging portal
softly ajar, slipped through and turned along the
corridor toward 29. Halfway, he thought he
heard a sound behind him, but he didn’t stop or
turn. He scuttled into 29—Bert had thoughtfully
left the door unlocked—and the instant the
latch had slipped into place behind him tore off
his coat and fumbled at his belt. The study was
empty and dark, but a light shone from Bert’s
bedroom and as Hugh hurried into his own apartment
a sibilant voice came to him.</p>

<p>“That you, Hugh?”</p>

<p>“Yes.” Hugh was slipping out of his trousers.
“I’ll be in in a minute.” He kicked off his shoes
and tugged at his tie.</p>

<p>“Where the dickens have you been?” demanded
Bert, more loudly. Hugh heard his bed creak
and a moment later his bare feet on the floor.
And that instant there was a gentle knock on
the door.</p>

<p>Hugh flung things from him wildly and dived
for his bed. There was silence. Then the knock
was repeated, and:</p>

<p>“Winslow!” came Cathcart’s cautious voice
from beyond the portal.</p>

<p>After a moment’s hesitation Bert, making a
good deal of noise about it, went to the door and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
flung it open. Hugh, the covers pulled to his
chin, held his breath and listened.</p>

<p>“Hello, Wallace.” That was Bert’s voice, surprised
and sleepy. “What’s up?”</p>

<p>“Sorry to disturb you,” said Cathcart, pushing
past Bert and closing the door behind him, “but
someone just came up the stairs and entered this
room.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” replied Bert, suppressing a yawn.
“You probably heard me coming from the bathroom.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t only hear, I saw,” said Cathcart quietly.
“You don’t usually visit the bathroom with
all your clothes on, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Not usually, old man, but I couldn’t find my
bathrobe. I suppose it’s somewhere around——”</p>

<p>“Is Ordway here?” demanded the proctor.</p>

<p>“I suppose so. We went to bed rather early.
Oh, Hugh!”</p>

<p>“Yes?” asked Hugh startledly. “Did you call,
Bert?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Cathcart asked if you were here. It’s
all right, I guess.”</p>

<p>“If you don’t mind,” murmured Cathcart. He
crossed to Hugh’s room and looked in. “Would
you mind turning on a light, please, Bert?”</p>

<p>Bert obeyed grumblingly and Cathcart viewed
the bedroom. Hugh’s coat lay on the floor near<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
the foot of the bed, his trousers were in front
of the dresser, one shoe was on top the trousers
and the other a yard away and his shirt hung
limply from the footrail. Cathcart took it all in
silently and gravely. Then:</p>

<p>“How long have you been in bed, Ordway?”
he asked.</p>

<p>“Eh? In bed? Oh, really, I can’t say. What
time is it now?”</p>

<p>“You just came in, as a matter of fact, didn’t
you?”</p>

<p>“Now look here, Cathcart,” interrupted Bert
persuasively. “You’re all wrong, old man. You
were dreaming, probably. You can see easily
enough that Ordway and I have been in bed for
a long time.”</p>

<p>“Does he usually leave his things around like
that?” asked the proctor.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid he does. He’s an untidy beggar.
You are, aren’t you, Hugh?”</p>

<p>“Perfectly rotten,” replied Hugh cheerfully.
“Still, you know, they’re awfully easy to find in
case of—er—fire or anything.”</p>

<p>Cathcart smiled wanly. Then he shook his
head. “I’m sorry, Ordway,” he said, “but I’ll
have to report you. Good night, fellows.”</p>

<p>“But, I say——” began Hugh.</p>

<p>“Look here, Cathcart, have a heart,” pleaded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
Bert. “You can’t prove anything against him.
Why, look at him! You say someone came in
here a minute ago. Now you know very well
Ordway couldn’t undress in that time!”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I said he entered a minute ago,
Bert. However, if Ordway cares to get out of
bed and show me that he has his pajamas on——”
He viewed Hugh inquiringly.</p>

<p>“Pajamas,” said Hugh indignantly. “Why, I
say, I never wear ’em, you know. Beastly uncomfortable
things, pajamas.”</p>

<p>“Indeed? May I look in here?” Cathcart
opened the closet door. On a hook inside hung
a pair of white pajamas with broad blue stripes.
“Yours, I think, Ordway?”</p>

<p>Hugh nodded. “Right-o, Cathcart,” he said.
“You win. What’s the penalty?”</p>

<p>“I can’t say,” replied the proctor. “I guess
it won’t amount to much. I wouldn’t try it again,
though, Ordway. They’re rather strict here about
being out of hall after hours. Probably you can
give a good explanation.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I can,” said Hugh. “Only,” he added
under his breath, “I’m switched if I’m going
to!”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, fellows,” said Cathcart again, regretfully.
“You know I have to do it, though.
Good night.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span></p>

<p>“Good night,” said Hugh. “Duty is duty, eh,
what?”</p>

<p>“Good night,” returned Bert morosely. “It
doesn’t seem to me, Wallace, that you need to be
so confounded snoopy, though! Of course you’re
a proctor, and all that, but a fellow doesn’t have
to go out of his way to look for trouble!”</p>

<p>“I didn’t go out of my way, Bert,” replied
Cathcart quietly. “I was awake and heard steps
on the stairs and then heard the door pushed
open. It was my place to see who was coming
up.”</p>

<p>“Then, if you saw him,” said Bert crossly,
“what was the good of coming down here and
making all this fuss?”</p>

<p>“I saw only his back, and the light was dim.
I couldn’t be certain whether it was you or Ordway.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” Bert shot a glance at Hugh, now sitting
up in bed and hugging his knees. “Then—then
perhaps it will interest you, Wallace, to learn
that it wasn’t Ordway, after all! It happened to
be me, old man. Put that in your pipe and smoke
it!” And Bert viewed the other truculently.</p>

<p>Cathcart smiled gently and shook his head.
“That won’t do, Bert,” he said. “Ordway’s
owned up, you see.”</p>

<p>“Because he thought I didn’t want to be reported.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
Besides, he didn’t own up. He only
said——”</p>

<p>“Oh, come, Bert! What’s the use?” asked
Cathcart. “I know it was Ordway.”</p>

<p>“You do? Even when I say it wasn’t? When
I say it was me? You’re mighty smart, aren’t
you?”</p>

<p>Cathcart colored and frowned. “Very well,”
he said stiffly. “I’ll report you both and you can
settle it between you. I’m not quite such a fool
as you seem to think, Winslow.”</p>

<p>“I’m not <em>thinking</em>,” replied Bert impolitely.</p>

<p>“Stow it, you chaps,” Hugh broke in. “Be fair,
Bert. Cathcart’s only doing what he has to.
Much obliged for lying, old chap, but I don’t
really mind being reported. It’s all right, Cathcart,”
he added reassuringly. “I’m the culprit.
Sorry to get you out of bed.”</p>

<p>Bert opened his mouth to speak, thought better
of it and shrugged. Cathcart nodded to Hugh
and went out. When the door was closed behind
him and Bert had turned the key with a venomous
click he strode back to Hugh’s room and
eyed him wrathfully.</p>

<p>“Why the dickens did you have to butt in?”
he demanded. “I could have made him believe
it was me in another minute. You haven’t got as
much sense as—a—as a——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span></p>

<p>“Proctor?” suggested Hugh helpfully. Bert
grunted. Hugh threw the clothes aside and swung
his feet to the floor. “Mind tossing me those
pajamas?” he asked. “Thanks. Now, look here,
old chap——”</p>

<p>“You’ll get the very dickens, that’s what you’ll
get,” interrupted Bert. “Where were you? How
did you get in? Didn’t you know——”</p>

<p>“Yes, old dear, I knew all about it. The degrading
truth is that a half-dozen of those beastly
lower middle chaps got me and a couple of juniors
and locked us up in a classroom in School
Hall and I had to shin down the coats and trousers——”</p>

<p>“Shin down the <em>what</em>?”</p>

<p>Hugh smiled. “The coats and trousers. We
tied our coats together, you know,—and my
trousers, too,—and I got down that way and got
in a window at the back and unlocked the door.
Then I climbed in through the library.”</p>

<p>“Who were the lower middlers?” demanded
Bert hotly.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t see them. Dare say I shouldn’t have
known them if I had. It was all over in a jiffy.
Someone grabbed me from behind, another chap
throttled me and the whole lot pushed me upstairs.
Next thing I knew I was locked in that
room with a pair of silly juniors named Twining<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
and Struthers. Struthers wasn’t so bad, but Twining
was a mean little bounder. I say, you’ve a
remarkable looking mouth, old chap!”</p>

<p>“And you’ve got a fine-looking lump over that
eye! You’ll make a big hit with the faculty when
you’re called up tomorrow!”</p>

<p>“I can say I ran into a door,” replied Hugh
untroubledly. “I did once, you know, and had
just such a lump.”</p>

<p>“Huh! And I suppose running into the door
skinned your knuckles, too?”</p>

<p>“I’ll keep that hand behind me,” laughed Hugh.
“Anyway, it was a—a—it was some scrap, wasn’t
it?”</p>

<p class="cap">“The beauty of being on probation,” observed
Nick, “is that a fellow is able to
give his entire time to the improvement
of his mind. I recall that during my junior year
being on pro was very helpful to me. It allowed
me to do a lot of studying that I wouldn’t have
been able to accomplish otherwise, and so, without
doubt, preserved me to Grafton posterity. If
it hadn’t been for that thoughtful act on the part
of faculty you might not have me with you this

<p>“Faculty has a heap to answer for,” said Guy
sadly.</p>

me out of football, though, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and the worst of it is,” said Pop Driver,
“that you’ll have to go to gym and do your four
hours per week.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I shall mind that, really. I
fancy it’s dumb bells and clubs and that sort of
thing, eh?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, and bar bells and free arm movements,
which are tiresome things, and chest weights.
<em>Creak—creak—creak—creak!</em> I hate the thought
of the things.” And Nick disgustedly shook his
head.</p>

<p>“You got off easily, if you want to know it,”
said Bert. “Two weeks isn’t anything. Usually
it’s a month at least. The only thing that
saved you from getting it harder was that faculty
is up in the air about last night’s rumpus.
It has a sort of an idea that a lot of things
went on it doesn’t know about and that if justice
was done half the school would be on
pro.”</p>

<p>“They’re always easier with a new fellow,”
said Guy. “Two weeks will soon pass, Hugh.
Take my advice, though, and try for B’s in everything.
That always makes them happy and they’ll
let you off easy.”</p>

<p>“B’s?” exclaimed Bert. “Why B’s? Hugh
gets an A-minus in about everything now! By
the way, fellows, Jimmy’s been pussy-footing it all
over school today trying to find out what really
happened last night. He cornered me in lower
hall after French this morning and said he had
heard the juniors had held a very successful meeting.
You know the way he smiles when he wants
to—to lull your suspicions?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span></p>

<p>“Wow!” applauded Nick. “That’s langwidge!”</p>

<p>“So I said yes, I’d heard they had. And then
he asked: ‘You—ah—you weren’t present then
yourself, Winslow?’ And I said no, I didn’t think
the juniors allowed any of the other class fellows
at their meeting. Innocent, I was. So he said,
‘H’m, yes, very true, Winslow,’ and I beat it.
What gets me is that they didn’t hear the racket
and come out. I suppose, though, they thought
it was the usual rumpus.”</p>

<p>“There are some mighty funny-looking faces
around today,” observed Pop. “Phillips couldn’t
see at all out of one eye, and——”</p>

<p>“Phillips isn’t anything,” cut in Nick. “You
should see Downer! He’s positively disreputable!
I told him so, too. Told him he oughtn’t
to appear among gentlemen looking as he did.
He was quite short-tempered about it.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if they’ll do anything,” pondered
Bert.</p>

<p>“Someone said he’d heard they were going to
stop junior meeting after this,” replied Guy. “It
would be a good thing if they did. Such behavior
is most—er—reprehensible.”</p>

<p>“Piffle!” scoffed Nick. “You were just dying
to get into it yourself last night, you old hypocrite!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span></p>

<p>“I did get into it,” said Guy grimly. “And I
got this for my pains.” He laid a finger on his
bruise. “Pop was the one who put ’em to rights.
Pop went into it like a whirlwind. <em>Thump!</em>
Down goes a lower! <em>Bang!</em> Down goes an upper!
Great stuff, Pop!”</p>

<p>“You fellows could have fought all night,” replied
Pop calmly, “for all I cared, only I thought
it would be rather a silly piece of business for
half of you to get nabbed and put on pro. To
come right down to hunks, though, it was a pretty
rank piece of business for grown kids to pummel
each other for no reason at all. You upper
middlers ought to be proud of it.”</p>

<p>“Well, we didn’t start it,” said Nick aggrievedly.
“One of those chaps punched one of us
and so we punched back.”</p>

<p>“It’s always the other fellow who starts things,
I notice. If you and Bert and Kinley and a few
more had been caught at it a fat chance the team
would have had!”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” agreed Guy. “I understand that
Bonner was extremely eloquent this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“He flayed us,” said Bert grimly. “He has a
nasty tongue sometimes.”</p>

<p>“It struck me he was mighty easy with you,”
said Pop unfeelingly. “When you’re on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
School Team, Bert, you’re supposed to behave
yourself and not act like a kid.”</p>

<p>“Oh, chuck it, Pop,” returned Bert shortly.
“I’ve been lectured enough. You’re as cheerful
as a raven.”</p>

<p>“After all,” said Nick, “’is ’Ighness is the
only one should kick. He’s dished on football
for two weeks, anyway, and that queers him utterly
for this year. If anyone has a right to
grouch it’s Hugh, and he’s the most cheerful of
the lot.”</p>

<p>“Do you really think it lets me out for the
year?” asked Hugh sadly. “I was hoping that
maybe, if it was only two weeks, they’d let me
back on the—the—grinds.”</p>

<p>“The what?” demanded Nick. “Oh, the
scrubs! Grinds isn’t bad, though! That’s what
they do, all right.”</p>

<p>“Hope on, hope ever,” said Guy. “Put it up
to Ted some time. Maybe he will fix it for you.
Who’s going to captain the second this year,
Pop?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. I suppose it will be Ben Myatt.”</p>

<p>“Honest? Poor old Bennie! He’s been trying
for the first team for three years now. I
hoped he would make it this time.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he will, but I doubt it. Ben just<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
doesn’t reach to the first. He’s a clever player,
too.”</p>

<p>“Better than Tom Hanrihan, in my estimation,”
said Nick. “I’d like to see Ben make it
this time.”</p>

<p>“So would I,” agreed Pop, “but he isn’t the
player Tom is. Tom’s got the zip, you know.
Ben’s too good-natured, I guess.”</p>

<p>“There’s something in that,” mused Guy. “Remember
Powell, who pitched for us year before
last, Pop? He was a nifty twirler, all right, and
had a fast one that would fool you two times out
of three, but you simply couldn’t rile him, and
when things got away from us Powell was no
earthly use in the box. When you’re a run or
two behind along in the eighth or ninth you want
just nine fellows in the field who are mad clear
through!”</p>

<p>“I say,” exclaimed Hugh, “you’re spoofin’,
what?”</p>

<p>“Nary a spoof, Duke,” replied Guy. “Getting
your mad up is what does the business. I don’t
mean you’re to show it or froth at the mouth, you
understand, but you want to have it inside you.
Then when your chance comes you bust out and
something happens.”</p>

<p>“Really?” marveled Hugh. “I’ve always
thought quite the contrary. It seems to me, you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
know, that a chap who keeps his temper is the
one who can do the best.”</p>

<p>“Sure! I said that. <em>Have</em> a temper, but keep
it! Am I right, Pop?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think so. I know that when a fellow
plays football he has to sort of seethe inside before
he can really do much.”</p>

<p>“Did you ever seethe?” asked Nick incredulously.</p>

<p>“I’ve been mad enough to bite,” said Pop, smiling.
“Haven’t you?”</p>

<p>“Me? Great Scott, yes! But you’re such a
sleepy, unemotional beggar, Pop, that I didn’t
suppose you ever felt that way. Bert and I, now,
being sort of temperamental——”</p>

<p>“I always get mad,” confessed Bert, “the first
time a fellow tackles me or gives me a jolt. I’ve
got a rotten temper, anyway.”</p>

<p>“Good reason to play football, then,” said Pop.
“Football’s a fine thing for temper.”</p>

<p>“I fancy I’d never make a player, then,” remarked
Hugh ruefully. “I don’t get angry very
easily, you see.”</p>

<p>His regret was so evident that the others
laughed, and Nick said: “Don’t worry about
that, ’Ighness. You’ll get over it bravely when
you come to play. Just let a couple of fellows
sit on your head and another one twist your<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
ankle for you and you’ll be mad enough to eat
dirt!”</p>

<p>Nothing came of Thursday night’s affair. Possibly
faculty didn’t quite know where to begin,
since fully two-thirds of the school was concerned.
The fracas went down in history as the Junior
Meeting Riot, and the <cite>Campus</cite>, the school
monthly, managed to get a lot of sly fun out of it
in its next issue. Leslie and several other more
prominent members of the senior class were taken
to task for allowing matters to go as far as they
had, which, considering the fact that they had
sustained various injuries in their efforts to promote
peace, was rather unkind. In the end faculty
prohibited future interference with junior
meeting and, lest the temptation should prove
too great for the lower middlers, provided that
the meeting should take place in Manning common
room.</p>

<p>Hugh took his punishment philosophically, although
he really regretted having to give up trying
for the football team. He had just begun
to find something besides hard work in the daily
practice, and, while he hadn’t for a moment counted
on making the first, he had entertained hopes
of finding a place on the second team. It was
Tom Hanrihan who took the matter hardest.
Tom, a big, raw-boned, good-hearted chap of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
eighteen, took his commission of coaching the
“rookies” very seriously, and Hugh’s defection
grieved him sadly. The talk that Hugh had received
from Jimmy, otherwise the assistant principal,
Mr. Rumford, was nothing to what Hanrihan
had to say to him Saturday morning. Hanrihan
told Hugh quite explicitly how many kinds
of an idiot he was and would listen to no excuses.</p>

<p>“You seem to think all we have to do is waste
time on you fellows and then you can drop out
whenever it pleases you. Making a football
team isn’t any cinch, Ordway, when you’ve got
only nine weeks to do it. You haven’t any right
to take up our time if you don’t mean to stick
it out.”</p>

<p>“But I did mean to stick it out,” expostulated
Hugh. “It wasn’t my fault if those beggars got
me and——”</p>

<p>“You shouldn’t have given them the chance.
You shouldn’t have had anything to do with that
scrap, anyway. (This despite the fact that the
speaker had a very puffy and discolored left eye!)
When a fellow goes out for the team he’s supposed
to look after himself. He’s trying for the—the
biggest thing in school, and he ought to realize
it. You had a good chance to make good.
I as much as told you that a dozen times. (If<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
he had, Hugh didn’t recall it!) You showed
some gumption, and you were quick and handled
a ball nicely. Now you’ve gone and spoiled it
all. Honest, Ordway, I’d like to punch your
head for you!”</p>

<p>“Oh, very well, do it,” replied Hugh meekly.
“I’m sorry. That’s all I can say, Hanrihan.”</p>

<p>“A lot of good being sorry does,” snorted the
other.</p>

<p>“It’s only two weeks, Mr. Rumford said, and
I thought that possibly I could get back again,”
said Hugh wistfully.</p>

<p>“Get back! Lay off two weeks and get back!
That’s likely! By that time we’ll be in the middle
of the season. Who do you suppose is going
to take time to coach you individually, Ordway?”</p>

<p>“Well,” and Hugh smiled ingratiatingly at
Hanrihan, “you could, you know, if you cared
to!”</p>

<p>“I could!” Hanrihan stared in amazement.
“Well, you’re certainly a cheeky youngster, Ordway!
What the dickens should I do it for? You
don’t suppose the team’s going to pot just because
you’re out, do you?”</p>

<p>“N-no, of course not. I didn’t mean that.”
Hugh colored in his quick fashion. “Only, I
thought that possibly—if I sort of watched practice
and saw what was being done, why, after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
I was off probation, you might sort of—sort of
show me, if you know what I mean!”</p>

<p>“Huh! You’ll have to get Bonner to let you
back first. And I don’t think he will.” Hanrihan
paused. “He might, though, if I put it up
to him. Confound you, Ordway, you seem to
think you can do as you please and play hob all
around and then—then get folks to square things
for you! You <em>are</em> a cheeky youngster, and no mistake!”</p>

<p>“I dare say,” replied Hugh, “but you’ll speak
to Mr. Bonner, eh? You know yourself it wasn’t
my fault, old chap, now don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Well, no, I suppose it wasn’t—in a way,” acknowledged
Hanrihan more graciously. “Well,
I’ll see if we can do anything. But look here,
now. You keep in shape, do you understand?
And keep in right with faculty. No more nonsense,
Ordway!”</p>

<p>“Right-o! And thanks awfully, Hanrihan.”</p>

<p>“Don’t thank me until it happens—if it does,”
grumbled the other. “I’ll let you know if—if
anything comes up. So long.”</p>

<p>That conversation left Hugh hopeful again,
but when he recounted it to Bert the latter threw
cold water on the project. “Tom will do his
part,” he said, “but there isn’t a chance that Bonner
will let you back. I know him too well. I’m<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
sorry, Hugh. I wish he would. But I wouldn’t
expect too much if I were you.”</p>

<p>“I shan’t,” replied Hugh untroubledly. “But
there isn’t any harm in hoping, eh? Even if you
don’t get what you want you’ve had the fun of
wishing for it, if you know what I mean!”</p>

</div>


<p class="cap">Being on probation didn’t prevent Hugh
from seeing the game that Saturday afternoon,
and he and Guy and a lower middle
youth named Stiles sat together through the best
part of two hours and watched Grafton play two
twelve-minute and two ten-minute periods with
the Leeds High School team. It was unseasonably
warm for the first week in October and the
players felt the heat. The game dragged along
uninterestingly until, in the final period, Coach
Bonner put in a number of second-string players.
That brought the two teams nearer equality and,
although there was no more scoring, the last ten
minutes contained several exciting incidents.
Weston, at quarter-back in place of Nick, got
away on a sixty-five-yard run and all but scored.
A Leeds left end pulled down a forward pass for
a twelve-yard gain that momentarily looked like
a touchdown. Keyes, the only one of the back
field to play the game through, fooled the enemy
with a short punt that almost resulted in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
score when a Leeds player dropped the ball and
it was pulled out of the air by Siedhof. But in
the end the score remained as at the finish of the
first half, 13 to 0, in favor of the home team,
and Grafton dawdled back to the campus not
greatly impressed.</p>

<p>Hugh parted from Guy and Stiles and went on
up to his study. Bert was not yet back, and,
after thoughtfully staring from the window at
the passing groups below, he went out and down
the corridor to Number 34. His rap on the half-opened
door elicited a response and he entered
to find the single occupant of the room minus coat
and waistcoat, perched at the window and surrounded
by books and papers. Cathcart was tall
and thin, with a fair complexion and a good deal
of unruly red-brown hair. Just now, a green
shade over his eyes and a pair of black rubber
spectacles on his nose, he presented an amusing
vision as he glanced near-sightedly across. Cathcart
was eighteen, a senior and an acknowledged
“grind.” It was said of him that faculty had
almost broken his heart in his lower middle year
by refusing to let him take more than twenty-one
hours a week. He got as much pleasure out of
studying as Bert Winslow did from football or
Guy Murtha from baseball, and was absolutely
unable to get the point of view of the fellow who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
considered study a disagreeable thing to be avoided
as much as possible. It was not until Hugh
was halfway across the room, which combined
study and bedroom, that Cathcart recognized him.
When he did he untangled himself slowly, distributing
sheets of paper around the floor, and
slid to his feet.</p>

<p>“Hello,” he said doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Hello,” answered the visitor.</p>

<p>Then, without further remarks, they set to rescuing
the scattered papers. This gave them time
to consider the situation and when they faced each
other again Cathcart said: “About the other
night, Ordway: I hope you didn’t think there
was anything personal in what I did?”</p>

<p>“Not for a moment, Cathcart. I’d have done
just what you did, you know. That’s quite all
right, I assure you.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad you take it that way, really.
You see, being proctor has its drawbacks. I
wasn’t anxious for it, but it makes a big difference
in my expenses for the year, you see. I
get my room a good deal cheaper, and that’s
rather nice in my case. I was glad faculty let
you off as easily as they did, Ordway.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, yes, they were really very decent to
me. Where I made my mistake, Cathcart, was
in not coming up the other stairway.” Hugh<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
smiled. “You wouldn’t have heard me then, I
fancy.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I would,” agreed the other. “I—I
wish you had. Someone said you got shut up
in the gym, I believe?”</p>

<p>“In School Hall.” Hugh narrated his adventures
on Thursday evening.</p>

<p>“But if you had shouted out the window someone
would surely have heard you,” said Cathcart.</p>

<p>“Yes, but I didn’t want to give those lower middle
beggars the satisfaction, if you know what I
mean. And I rather funked having it get around
that I’d been such a silly ass, too! I say, I’m
keeping you from work, eh?”</p>

<p>“No, you’re not, really. Push those books
aside and make yourself comfortable. I wish
you’d tell me whether Bert has it in for me, Ordway.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t think so! He was a bit crumby
that night, but he soon gets over it.”</p>

<p>“I hope so. I like Bert. I suppose I’ll have
to make up my mind to getting a few of the fellows
down on me before the year’s over. Bound
to, I guess. It’s hard to make them realize that
it’s my duty to report things. They don’t think
anything about it if it’s one of the masters, but
they resent it if it’s a proctor. How do you like<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
the school, Ordway? I suppose it’s different from
your schools in England.”</p>

<p>“I fancy so. I never went to an English school,
though; never went to any school before I came
here. Of course I’ve heard lots about the English
schools; I know quite a few chaps at Rugby
and Charterhouse and Winchester; and I rather
fancy we’re a bit different here. But I like it
very much. Fact is, Cathcart, I was in a regular
blue funk about coming here. I rather thought
the chaps would rag me a lot, you know, but they
haven’t. Nick Blake does, but I don’t mind Nick
a bit. Of course, I am different, I fancy; rather
stupid about a lot of things; and I’m only just
beginning to understand that you chaps don’t
mean more than about half you say. It puzzled
me a lot at first, you know. You have a way
of poking fun at things, if you know what I mean,
that sounds odd until you understand that it <em>is</em>
fun. I didn’t; not at first. I’m learning, though.”</p>

<p>“I suppose we are different,” acknowledged
Cathcart, “in some ways. Sometimes I think we
don’t take things seriously enough, Ordway, we
fellows here at Grafton. Not that Grafton is
much different from other preparatory schools,
though.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I like,” said Hugh eagerly. “I
think your way of not taking things seriously is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
awfully jolly. It isn’t that you really don’t—don’t
<em>know</em> that they’re serious—when they are—but
you simply don’t take them so. As I say,
I’ve never been to an English school, but I’m sure
you fellows over here get a lot more fun than
we do on the other side. Just at first some of the
fun seemed to me to be rather—I say, I hope
you won’t mind it, old chap, but it seemed a bit
silly, if you know what I mean.”</p>

<p>“I think a lot of our fun is,” replied Cathcart,
“but it’s generally fairly harmless. Of course,
the other night was different, but that was exceptional
here. We aren’t in the habit of blacking
each other’s eyes, you see.”</p>

<p>“But I liked that! That was—was so jolly
spontaneous, eh? Some of the fun seems a bit—well,
a bit studied, but that wasn’t. A lot of
chaps have been awfully apologetic about that
affair, and I don’t see why. On the other
side we’d have thought nothing about it, and the
masters wouldn’t have noticed it, I fancy. But
we’re a bit more used to using our fists than you
chaps, I think. I say, though, here I am talking
like ‘a bloomin’ Britisher,’ as Nick says,
when I’m really just as much American as I am
English.”</p>

<p>“Are you really? That explains it, then.
There’s something about you that doesn’t seem<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
entirely English, Ordway. You don’t <em>look</em> terribly
English, for one thing.”</p>

<p>“My mother is American,” said Hugh. “Her
family has lived in Maryland ever since the place
was settled, I fancy. I’ve been over here off
and on, you know, ever since I was a kid. It’s
queer, Cathcart, but sometimes I feel as if I was
all American and sometimes as if I was all English!
Queer game, eh?”</p>

<p>“Jekyll and Hyde idea?” asked the other, with
a smile. “But don’t ask me which is Jekyll!”</p>

<p>“I won’t,” laughed Hugh. “Don’t want to
embarrass you. What’s that stuff you’re digging
at?”</p>

<p>“Benson’s ‘Medieval History,’” replied Cathcart.
“It’s very interesting.”</p>

<p>“But, I say, we don’t have that, do we?”</p>

<p>“No, I’m just taking it up as a reading course.
I have a good deal of spare time this term and
next, you see.”</p>

<p>“Fancy that! I dare say you’re a regular shark
at study, eh? Honor Man and all that?”</p>

<p>“Well, yes, I was Honor Man three terms
last year and two the year before and one in my
junior year. It isn’t hard, you know.”</p>

<p>“Do you go in for games at all? Tennis or
golf or anything?”</p>

<p>“N-no, not now. I play tennis a little, but I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
haven’t done much at it since spring. There
doesn’t seem to be much time.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but look here, old chap, tennis would do
you a jolly sight more good than Whatshisname’s
‘Medieval History’!”</p>

<p>“I don’t feel the need of it, Ordway. You see
I have gym work during the fall and winter terms
and then in spring I go in for tennis a couple
of times a week.”</p>

<p>“You need more than that. Look here, I’m
out of football for a couple of weeks anyhow,
Cathcart. What do you say we have a try at
tennis some day? What hours do you have in
the mornings?”</p>

<p>“I’m pretty full every morning but Thursday
and Saturday,” replied the other doubtfully. “I
wouldn’t be much of a fellow for you to play
with, Ordway. I’m terribly stale. Fact is, I only
do it in spring because I have to.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m no marvel, old chap! Anyway, that
doesn’t matter, does it? We can have some sport.
What time Thursday, now?”</p>

<p>Cathcart laughed. “Well, eleven to twelve, if
you really want me to play.”</p>

<p>“Eleven to twelve is all right for me. Don’t
forget. Got a good racket?”</p>

<p>“Why, come to think of it, I don’t believe I
know where it is. Seems to me someone borrowed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
it last term. I’ll have a look for it,
though.”</p>

<p>“Don’t bother too much about it. I’ve got one
you may use and welcome. I say, I hope you
don’t think me awfully cheeky to come in and
take up your time, eh?”</p>

<p>“I don’t, indeed, Ordway! I think it mighty
nice of you. I was rather afraid you held it
in for me, you see.”</p>

<p>“Oh, rot! As though I would! Thursday at
eleven, then? I’ll stop here for you, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes, do, for I might forget it. Thursday’s
a good way off, though, and if you find time you
might drop in again. It’s good to talk with a
fellow who doesn’t spout football every minute!”</p>

<p>“Right-o! And come across to 29, Cathcart,
will you? There are heaps of things I’d like to
talk about.”</p>

<p>Hugh usually had his last recitation at one,
and that left him a long afternoon to get through
with. One could always study, but when the
weather was fair, and it held fair that autumn
well into November, staying indoors was not what
he wanted. He had one or two set-to’s at tennis
with various acquaintances but by three o’clock
he was always on hand at the first team gridiron,
following the play and trying his best to profit by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
what he saw. There was no cheering news from
Hanrihan, however, that week, nor had Hugh
taken Guy’s advice and spoken to Ted Trafford
about his reinstatement. He didn’t feel up to doing
that, but would have been highly pleased had
Bert or Nick done it for him. Neither did,
though, so far as he learned. They seemed to
accept his termination with football as final for
that fall. The only incidents of importance that
week were the tennis with Wallace Cathcart on
Thursday and the football game with St. James’
Academy on Saturday.</p>

<p>The tennis was something of a surprise to
Hugh. He secretly thought rather well of himself
as a player, although he never boasted, and
had expected to have the rather awkward appearing
Cathcart at his mercy. But things turned
out differently and Hugh had to work hard for
the two sets they played. In spite of the fact
that his opponent didn’t take the game seriously
and had not, according to his statement, played
since the preceding spring, he was able to give
Hugh a hard tussle. Cathcart had a bewildering
serve when, towards the middle of the first
set, he began to get command of it, and he possessed
a remarkably clever way of getting about
the court. Weak on backhand strokes, he wisely
avoided them whenever possible and spun the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
ball across low and hard from the face of his
racket in a way that made Hugh admire and marvel.</p>

<p>When, at the end of the first set, won by Hugh,
6–4, they rested a minute, Hugh took Cathcart
to task. “I say, old chap, it’s a crying shame for
you not to play more. Why, you’re a natural
tennis player, ’pon my word you are! Look here,
why don’t you, eh?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.” Cathcart, breathing hard
from his exertions, thought a moment. “I really
believe I could play fairly decently if I put my
mind on it and practiced. And it is good fun.
I’d forgotten what fun it was, Ordway. Do you
think you could show me how to get those backhand
returns? Or wouldn’t you care to?”</p>

<p>“Glad to! The trouble is you funk ’em, you
know.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid of them. If I can’t get into position
to take them on the right I let them go.
I’m awfully weak on backhand work.”</p>

<p>“Practice is all you need, then. That’s a perfectly
spif—a perfectly corking serve of yours!
I have to take it almost at the backline, do you
know? Shall we go on?”</p>

<p>In the second set Cathcart won the second and
fourth on his service and then, losing the sixth
to Hugh, took advantage of the latter’s momentary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
let-down and made the set four-all. After
that, though, he tired and Hugh had no difficulty
in winning the ninth and tenth games and capturing
the set by the previous score.</p>

<p>Cathcart agreed to play again Saturday morning,
but begged off the next day, having discovered
some work he ought to do. Hugh took Ned
Stiles on instead, but had poor sport.</p>

<p>The St. James game in the afternoon was a
rattling good one. For the first time that season
Coach Bonner put his full strength into the
field at the start. Dresser was at left end, Franklin
at left tackle, Kinley at left guard, Musgrave
at center, Driver at right guard, Trafford at right
tackle, Tray at right end, Blake at quarter, Winslow
at left half, Vail at right half, and Keyes at
full. St. James was a heavy team, averaging
a year more in age, perhaps, and surely ten pounds
more in weight, and played close-formation football
in a very clever manner. Grafton’s game
this year, so far as one could determine at this
stage, was to be a combination of wide-open and
old-style football. She had an experienced trio
in Musgrave, Driver and Trafford, a fair guard
in Kinley and a good tackle in Franklin. Roy
Dresser, at left end, was almost certain of his
position, but Tray, on the other wing, was less
satisfactory. In the back-field, Blake and Winslow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
had seen two years of service on the first and
second teams, Vail was a newcomer in football,
although a senior, and Keyes had made the team
at the end of the preceding season. The back-field
was rather lighter than Mr. Bonner could
have wished for, but it was fast and “scrappy.”
So far it gave promise of being a good defensive
eleven, with its offensive abilities still to be proved.</p>

<p>Today’s game showed up many weak points,
for St. James was a hard enough proposition
to cause Grafton to make use of everything she
knew. It was St. James who scored first, shortly
after the kick-off, when Nick misjudged a punt
in front of his goal and a brown-stockinged player
fell on the pigskin near the twenty-yard line.
Grafton gave back slowly, but the visitors made it
first down on the nine yards. Then two tries
failed to gain more than as many feet and the
St. James full-back booted the ball over very
prettily.</p>

<p>Grafton came back hard and forced the playing
for the remainder of the period but was unable
to get a score. In the second quarter, Nick
began a march from the middle of the field to the
Brown’s goal that would not be denied and Keyes
was eventually pushed over for a touchdown.
Keyes failed at the goal. St. James gained on
rushes against Kinley when she got the ball back,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
but the half ended with the score 6 to 3 in the
home team’s favor.</p>

<p>When the third period opened Trafford kicked
off and St. James again started her smashing at
tackle and guard on the left, but the gains grew
shorter there and she switched to the other wing
and finally got her left half around Tray for a
twenty-yard sprint that laid the pigskin in dangerous
proximity to the Scarlet-and-Gray goal.
Some hard fighting followed, with St. James digging
her cleats valiantly and smashing at everything
in sight. Hugh got very excited at this
period of the contest and squirmed about on his
seat in a most un-English manner. Grafton took
the ball away on her twelve yards and the stands
cheered with joy and relief.</p>

<p>But the joy was short-lived, for Keyes punted
miserably from behind his goal line and the ball
was St. James’ again near the twenty-yards. She
got five on the very first play between Kinley and
Franklin and followed it with three more off
Franklin. The latter was hurt in the play and
Parker took his place. St. James lost slightly on
a run around end, but gained her distance on the
next down when a fake kick developed into a
line-plunge through center.</p>

<p>Grafton, flocking along the edge of the field,
implored her warriors to “Hold ’em!” But with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
less than ten yards to go and four downs at her
command the prospect looked extremely good for
the visitor. A plunge at Kinley was stopped for
no gain. Then a complicated crisscross play
sent a half-back past Captain Trafford for three
yards, Tray being boxed to the king’s taste.
Grafton began to breathe easier then, but the
third down added two yards more when the St.
James full-back tore through Kinley. That
brought the ball to the five-yard line, and the
Brown team arranged itself for a try at goal.
Ted Trafford diagnosed the play as a fake and
Nick hustled his back-field close in. When the
ball went back it was caught by a half who faked
an end run and then, when the left wing of the
Grafton line had been drawn in, threw across to
his right end. That youth had only to drop
across the line to score the touchdown. In fact
drop was all he could do, for Bert tackled him
the moment the ball settled into his hands. The
punt-out landed the pigskin directly in front of
the crossbar and St. James added another point,
bringing her total to 10. The whistle sounded a
moment later.</p>

<p>Grafton had now to score at least five points
to win. A field goal and a safety would do it, or
two field goals or a touchdown, but with only ten
minutes left none of those seemed very likely.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
When, however, Nick had sent Vail around the
enemy’s right flank for some eighteen yards and
followed it by breaking through the Brown’s center
himself for six more, putting the ball on the
St. James’ thirty-two yards just three minutes
after the last period had begun, the Grafton supporters
became more hopeful. Keyes smashed
into the line twice for a total of five, and it was
first down on the enemy’s twenty-seven yards.
Then, when the Scarlet-and-Gray scented a touchdown
or, at the least, a field-goal, Vail fumbled
a pass and a St. James forward squirmed through
and snuggled the pigskin beneath him.</p>

<p>St. James kicked on second down and Bert
caught on his own forty-three yards and ran back
five. Grafton opened her line wide and passed
obliquely to Vail and the right half dodged past
two white marks before he was stopped. Delayed
passes brought short gains and the pigskin was
on the Brown’s forty. Keyes got two off left
tackle, Bert failed to gain at the center and Keyes
punted to St. James’ five-yard line. Tray stopped
the quarter for little gain and St. James kicked
from behind her goal after one weak attempt at
rushing. Nick caught near the sideline at about
the thirty-two yards and started a run that
wrought Grafton to a condition of frenzied excitement.
He passed four of the enemy, running<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
straight along the white boundary, dodged a
half-back near the fifteen yards and was only
stopped when the St. James quarter forced him
out at the eight yards.</p>

<p>Grafton cheered exultantly and shouted
“Touchdown! Touchdown!” and Coach Bonner,
thus far chary of substitutes, sped four into the
line-up. Yetter went in for Kinley, Weston for
Nick Blake, Milford for Tray, and Zanetti for
Vail. It was Zanetti who made the first try
and gained two yards on a wide end run. That
brought the ball directly in front of goal. From
a kick formation Bert plunged at left guard and
when the resulting confusion of bodies had been
untangled the pigskin lay almost on the three
yards. With the crowd yelling like mad, Keyes
again went back and held out his hands, Nick
called his signals and Roy Dresser, on an end-around
play, carried the ball across the line almost
unmolested, the fake attack on the center
fooling the defenders completely!</p>

<p>Just to prove that he could kick a goal, even
if he had failed in his previous attempt, Keyes put
it over from a wide angle, and Grafton’s score
was 13. The period came to an end a minute or
so later, the final score, 13 to 10, and St. James
cheered a bit disgruntledly and Grafton quite contentedly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span></p>

<p>Hugh, having passed through a succession of
thrills that had left him rather limp, loitered back
to the tennis courts and, finding a seat on a stone
roller, watched a game of doubles without seeing
much of it. The contest he had just witnessed
had settled his conviction that he wouldn’t be at
all happy unless he was allowed to return to the
football field and try for a place on the scrubs.
Just now he felt quite certain that, given the opportunity,
he could prove his right to a position
there, and, while the white balls darted to and
fro across the nets unseen by him and the voices
of the players fell on deaf ears, he drew beautiful
mental pictures in all of which he, Hugh Oswald
Brodwick Ordway, clad in canvas and
leather, stood out very prominently.</p>

<p>After a while he discovered that the courts
were almost deserted and that he was shivering,
and so, plunging hands in pockets in Grafton fashion,
he tramped thoughtfully back to Lothrop.</p>

</div>


<p class="cap">“What do you think about when you are
running with the ball as you were yesterday?”
asked Hugh.</p>

<p>“Think about?” repeated Nick. “Why, I
don’t know. Nothing, I guess. There isn’t time.
You just—just run like the dickens and watch for
the opponents and get ready to straight-arm them
or side-step them or something, you know, and
keep on going until they nab you. Then you
hold on to the ball hard and try to drop easy and
get your head out of the way. I suppose you
really do do a whole lot of thinking, ’Ighness, but
it’s sort of like a dream. That is, you can’t remember
afterwards. I’ve heard fellows who
have made long runs, maybe the length of the
field, or pretty near, tell afterwards just what
they thought and planned, but I don’t believe
them. They made that up afterwards. You
don’t do much planning. You couldn’t, anyway.
You get the ball and look for a place to turn in.
Then a fellow smashes at you and you dodge<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
him if you can or you put your hand out and let
him have it hard. And then two or three others
are coming at you and you swing in, maybe, or
you swing out, and you get by them somehow—you
never know quite how—and you beat it as
hard as you can for the goal line. And about
that time the quarter or a half makes for you and
you try to get past him, and you do or you don’t.
Mostly you don’t!”</p>

<p>“It must be jolly exciting,” mused Hugh. “I
thought they had you two or three times yesterday
before they had.”</p>

<p>“So did I. I missed my guess with that quarter
of theirs. I thought that if I kept near the
side line he would think I meant to turn in and
then I’d keep on straight. But he didn’t fall for
it.”</p>

<p>“Why, then you did think, after all, didn’t
you?”</p>

<p>Nick looked puzzled. “I guess I must have,”
he acknowledged. “I guess you’d call it unconscious
cerebration. Here we are!”</p>

<p>It was afternoon of Sunday, the day succeeding
the St. James game, and Nick and Hugh
were going canoeing. A backwater of the river
formed a little cove in the southwest corner of
the playing field and save when the water was
very high there was a slope of coarse sand and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
gravel there which was facetiously called the
Beach, just as the cove was known as the Pool.
It provided a fairly good place for swimming,
since the water was not deep, although the mud
was somewhat of a drawback; and it made a convenient
haven for canoes. They were drawn up
on the grass under the well-nigh leafless branches
of a grove of maple and ash trees, a flotilla of
some twenty brightly hued craft. Nick’s canoe,
which he owned in partnership with Bert, was
easily located, for it was the only white one in
the lot. It had a neat stripe of gold along its
side and the name in gilt letters at the bow:
<i>Omeomi</i>. Hugh had been fooled by that name,
to Nick’s delight, pronouncing it Om-e-om-e, believing
the statement that it was an Indian word.
Nick, however, pronounced it “O me! O my!”</p>

<p>Hugh took a paddle and seated himself in the
bow and Nick pushed off and guided the gleaming
craft out of the cove and around a point of
alders to the river. There he headed up stream,
against a barely perceptible current.</p>

<p>“Now dig if you like,” he called, and Hugh
dipped his paddle very awkwardly and tried his
best to perform as he had seen Nick and others
perform. But this was his first attempt and he
wasn’t very successful. Nick let him toil for
several minutes. Then:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span></p>

<p>“’Ighness,” he said, “if you want to learn to
paddle you’ll have to start right. Put your left
hand further down and—— Hold on! Don’t
lean over like that or we’ll have to walk home!
Put your hand just above the end of the blade.
That’s it. Now, instead of reaching out close
to the bow, start your stroke farther off and sort
of pull it in. If you don’t you’re pushing the bow
to the right every stroke, don’t you see? Personally,
I don’t mind, but the next chap might not
like to have to keep straightening out every time.
That’s better, but your stroke’s too long, ’Ighness.
Shorten it up. Shorter still. That’s more like
it. Don’t try to push when the blade’s behind
you, because it doesn’t do any good. It rather
slows the canoe up, in fact. Forces the stern
down and makes it drag more water. Get your
drive at the beginning of the stroke, then let up
as the paddle passes you and finish the stroke
quickly. Try it.”</p>

<p>Hugh tried it, at first with amusing results,
and Nick had to dig hard at times to keep the
craft in its course. But after a while the bow
paddler became more adept. Then Nick tried
to teach him to turn his blade as it left the water,
but that trick was for the present beyond the novice.
Once Hugh lost his paddle entirely and
they had to float downstream after it. They went<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
some two miles in the direction of Needham
Falls, by which time the neighboring town was in
sight across the fields, and then pulled the nose
of the canoe up on the bank and rested. The afternoon
was still and the October sunlight warm,
and Hugh, for one, was ready for the respite.
They laid themselves full length on a bed of yellowing
marsh grass, pillowing their heads in
their clasped hands, and pulled their caps over
their eyes.</p>

<p>“Paddling a canoe’s harder work than I fancied,”
mused Hugh, conscious of lame muscles.</p>

<p>“You’ll soon get onto it. The next time you’d
better try the stern.”</p>

<p>“I suppose that’s more difficult.”</p>

<p>“A little. You’ve got to steer, too, you see.
But it isn’t hard once you’ve got the hang of it.
Funny you’ve never done any canoeing.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I dare say. I’ve punted a bit, and I’ve
rowed some, but you don’t find many canoes on
the other side except on the Thames. And
mother was always rather shy about letting me
go on the water.”</p>

<p>“It must be dandy on that Thames of yours,”
said Nick. “I’ve read about the races, you know,
and all that; houseboats lined up along the shore
and Johnnies in flannels paddling about and colored
lanterns and so on. Must be great!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span></p>

<p>“I dare say. I never saw but one boat race.
That was the time you—we—the American crew
beat us—them.”</p>

<p>“You’re getting mixed, ’Ighness!” laughed
Nick. “You don’t know whether you’re United
States or English.”</p>

<p>“It’s a bit confusing,” agreed Hugh. “Of
course, I really am English, because my father is
English and I was born over there. But sometimes
it seems awfully much as though I weren’t,
you know! Since I’ve been here I feel as if I
really belonged, if you know——”</p>

<p>“If I know what you mean; I do, old man.
Just the same, Hugh, you’d be in an awful mess
if we ever went to war with England, wouldn’t
you? What would you do then?”</p>

<p>Hugh shook his head soberly. “I don’t know,
really. I fancy, though, I’d stick with dad. I
couldn’t do anything else, could I?”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how you could. Wouldn’t it be
touching when you and I met on the trampled field
of battle? ‘Why, hello, ’Ighness!’ I’d say.
‘How’s the boy? Take that!’ And I’d biff you
one on the side of the head. And you’d say,
smiling pleasantly: ‘Well, well, if it isn’t me old
friend Nick! I’m chawmed to meet you, Nick.
Pardon me, but I’ve got to hand you this!’ And
then you’d stick a bayonet into my ribs. Or, no,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
you wouldn’t, either, because you’d be an officer,
I guess; maybe Field Marshal Ordway; and so
you’d let me have it with a sword! And then
you’d get the Victoria Cross for bravery.”</p>

<p>“Maybe you’d be an officer, too,” Hugh suggested,
smiling.</p>

<p>“Oh, I should! I’d be General Blake, Commander
of the United States Expeditionary
Forces; and so, instead of beating you over the
bean with the butt end of my rusty trifle—er,
trusty rifle, I’d slash off your head with my bejeweled
sword. There’d be some style to that,
eh?”</p>

<p>“Don’t see what good the V. C. would do me
under the circumstances,” objected Hugh. “I’m
not keen for that programme, Nick. I say, isn’t it
getting late? Hadn’t we better nip it?”</p>

<p>“Almost half-past four, by ginger! Never
mind, we’ve got the current with us going back,
and you can rest up. How are the shoulders and
sturdy biceps, Duke?”</p>

<p>“Rather lame, thanks.”</p>

<p>“Don’t mention it. Chawmed, I’m sure. Tumble
in and I’ll shove her off.”</p>

<p>The next day the second team became an official
fact. Mr. Crowley, the assistant athletic
director, took charge of the coaching and the
squad of nineteen started in at training table in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
Manning that noon. Ben Myatt was chosen captain.
As usual, Hugh went over to the field after
school in the afternoon and looked on. He had
secretly hoped to make an end position on the
second, but there were Bellows and Forbes in the
coveted places, and no word had come from
Hanrihan. He began to believe, with Bert, that
his chances for this year were at an end.</p>

<p>The first was going through signal drill, Nick
driving one squad and Weston the other. Behind
each line-up a few sweatered substitutes followed.
Neil Ayer was at quarter for the second, further
down the field, and Mr. Crowley, familiarly
known as “Dinny,” with a half-dozen unplaced
candidates, looked on. There was just a suspicion
of frost in the air today, and the fact told
on the players. There was more vim in their
movements as, in response to the voices of the
quarter-backs, they trotted up and down with the
balls. Coach Bonner and Jim Quinn, the manager,
were conversing in front of the bench, and
Davy Richards, the trainer, was mending a head-guard
discarded by one of the players a few minutes
before. Hugh wondered what Mr. Bonner
would say if he broached the subject of reinstatement.
At the worst he could only scowl and say
no. And he might say yes! But—well, Coach
Bonner wasn’t the sort of man one felt like making<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
suggestions to! Besides, Hanrihan had told
Hugh to wait.</p>

<p>There were few onlookers about the first team
gridiron today, for the upper and lower middlers
were playing the first of the class games on the
further field and the crowd was over there.
Hugh was debating whether to follow or to remain
here in the hope of getting some word from
Hanrihan when that youth came to the bench. In
front of him the second team squad, players and
followers, came to a breathless pause after a forward
pass and Mr. Crowley, short, square, red-faced,
criticized gruffly. At that moment Hugh
became conscious of someone at his shoulder and
heard Mr. Smiley’s deep and pleasant voice.</p>

<p>“What do you think of them, Ordway?” asked
the Latin instructor.</p>

<p>“Smiles” was a fine, upstanding man well under
forty, clean-shaven, tanned, gray-eyed. Although
he lived in the master’s suite on the third floor of
Lothrop, Hugh had never had more than a nod
or a “Good morning” from him and was rather
surprised that Smiles knew his name.</p>

<p>“They look rather fit, sir,” replied the boy.</p>

<p>“Yes. I hope Mr. Crowley will turn us out a
good second. A lot depends on the scrubs. I
understand they’ve chosen Myatt for captain. A
fine fellow and a good player. Too bad he’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
never made the varsity team. When he was a
lower middler we all looked to see him captain
this year. He lacks something, though.”</p>

<p>“I heard a fellow say Myatt was too good-natured,
sir.”</p>

<p>“I wonder! Meaning easy-going, I suppose.
Perhaps. Well, he may be able to do more for
us where he is than if he were on the first. Ah,
we’re to have a scrimmage I see. I suppose you
don’t play our kind of football, Ordway.”</p>

<p>“I was trying, sir. I went out for the team,
but——”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t quite get the hang of it?”</p>

<p>“I had to stop, sir. I’m on probation.”</p>

<p>“To be sure. I remember now. Too bad.
Well, you’ll have your class team to try for when
you get squared again.”</p>

<p>“Y-yes, sir,” agreed Hugh dubiously, “but—but
I was hoping to get back with the second.
Hanrihan said he thought I might. Do you—do
you think so, sir?”</p>

<p>“Hm. I’m afraid the second will be rather far
along then. When do you expect to get off?”</p>

<p>“This week, sir, I hope.”</p>

<p>“Well, in that case—have you spoken to Mr.
Crowley?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, I didn’t quite like to, if you know
what I mean.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span></p>

<p>The master smiled. “I think I do, Ordway.
But I don’t see how you expect to get back unless
you ask.”</p>

<p>“Hanrihan told me he would try to—to arrange
it.”</p>

<p>“But Tom Hanrihan hasn’t anything to do
with the second team, I’m afraid, Ordway.”</p>

<p>“I fancy not, sir. I thought perhaps I’d speak
to Mr. Bonner.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Bonner has no more to do with it than
Hanrihan. See Mr. Crowley. He will hear
what you have to say. You know him, I suppose.”</p>

<p>Hugh shook his head. “No, sir, I don’t.”</p>

<p>“Well, wait until he comes off and we’ll speak
to him. He’s coming now, I think. We’ll take
the bull by the horns.” Mr. Smiley chuckled, and
Hugh had to smile, too, for the simile was unflatteringly
apt. Mr. Crowley did remind one remarkably
of a bull! “‘<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Audentes fortuna iuvat</i>,’
Ordway, if you haven’t forgotten your Latin.”</p>

<p>Hugh followed the master to where the second
team coach was approaching the bench in company
with Ben Myatt. Hugh lagged a little, for,
while it might be true that fortune favored the
brave, it was equally true that Mr. Crowley
didn’t know him from Adam and might think him
decidedly fresh. There was a word or two of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
greeting between the men, during which Myatt
slipped away, and then Mr. Smiley turned to
Hugh.</p>

<p>“This is Ordway, Mr. Crowley. He’s looking
for a job and thinks you may have an opening for
a bright young man.”</p>

<p>“Looking for a job?” said the coach, shaking
hands. “What sort of a job, my boy?”</p>

<p>Hugh reddened. “I’d like to get back on the
second, sir,” he explained embarrassedly. “You
see, I was getting on fairly well until I went on
probation, and——”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, Hanrihan mentioned you, I think.
Ordway, is it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I thought maybe you might let me
have another try, Mr. Crowley, if you know
what——”</p>

<p>“Are you square with the office now?” demanded
the other.</p>

<p>“Not today, sir, but I shall be by Friday, I
fancy.”</p>

<p>“Then you come and see me Friday, Ordway.”</p>

<p>“Thank you.”</p>

<p>“But don’t come unless you can play. And if
you do come”—and here Mr. Crowley scowled
fearsomely—“see that you stay. We haven’t any
room for cut-ups on the team, Ordway. You
won’t be of any use to me unless you can stay<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
straight with the faculty.” Mr. Crowley dismissed
Hugh and his affairs with a nod and
turned back to Mr. Smiley. Hugh dropped out
of hearing and presently the master rejoined him.</p>

<p>“Are you going to watch the scrimmage?”
asked the latter. “If so, suppose we sit down
over there. Your friend at court seems to have
provided for you, after all. I’m glad you’re to
get back.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir. It was good of you to—to——”</p>

<p>“Not at all, Ordway, but I shall expect you to
make the most of your chance and become a distinguished
member of the team.” The master
smiled. “When you slam the ball across the line
I shall proudly recall the slight assistance I rendered
and partake of the credit. Now then, first
kicks off to the second. ‘The trumpet hoarse
rings out the bloody signal for the war!’ Well
kicked, Trafford!”</p>

<small>BACK TO THE FOLD</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Bert was as surprised as he was delighted
when Hugh informed him after practice
that Mr. Crowley had virtually promised
him a place with the second team. At first Bert
insisted that his chum had misunderstood, but,
on having the conversation repeated, acknowledged
that Hugh had good grounds for encouragement.
“I never heard of its being done before,
Hugh,” he said. “Tom Hanrihan must
have a drag with Dinny, and no mistake. You’ll
have to work like the dickens to stay on. Think
you can do it?”</p>

<p>“I fancy I can do as well as some of those
chaps there now,” answered Hugh placidly.</p>

<p>“Bellows isn’t bad at end, I guess,” mused
Bert, “but Forbes oughtn’t to be hard to beat.
You’re trying for end, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“I wanted to play end, but I wasn’t there long
enough to get placed more than once or twice.
End’s about all I can play, I fancy. I’m not
heavy enough for tackle or guard or back.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span></p>

<p>“You’d make a good quarter if you had more
experience,” said Bert thoughtfully. “And they
might use you for a running back. You’re quick,
I guess.”</p>

<p>“I’d be laid flat if I ran into Ted Trafford or
Pop, though,” laughed Hugh. “Pop could take
me up and throw me clear over the goal. I fancy
end is my place, if I can get it.”</p>

<p>Nick was equally pleased and, like Bert,
seemed to think that fortune had been unusually
kind to Hugh. “But you’re a lucky guy, anyway,
Duke. Some fellows are born to good fortune, I
guess, and you’re one of them. That was nice of
Smiles, though, wasn’t it? Don’t you like him,
Hugh?”</p>

<p>“Very much. We had a topping time. And,
I say, you chaps, he knows an awful lot of football!”</p>

<p>Bert and Nick laughed. “Why shouldn’t he?”
asked Bert. “He played it for three or four
years and came near making the all-America
team, didn’t he, Nick?”</p>

<p>“So they say. Anyway, I’ll bet he was a dandy
guard. When he first came here he used to help
with the coaching. That was before Dinny
came.”</p>

<p>“And after. Dinny didn’t coach the elevens
until the first fall we were here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span></p>

<p>“I didn’t know that. I thought Dinny was
always a football coach.”</p>

<p>“No, they got him because Pete had too much
to do. Dinny was supposed to give all his time
to the track team and nine. Then they got Davy
to look after the track fellows and so Dinny took
hold of the second team.”</p>

<p>“I should think that Mr. Smiley would be a
ripping football coach,” said Hugh.</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Nick. “He took hold of the
upper middlers two years ago and they ran away
with everything and even held the first team to
no score once. Remember, Bert?”</p>

<p>“That was three years ago, though, because I
was a junior then. That was some team, Nick,
wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Remember how it beat Grammar
School thirty-four to nothing, or something like
that? And Grammar School made a big howl
about it and wrote to the paper that we’d played
a lot of first team fellows against them.”</p>

<p>“Has Mr. Smiley anything to do with athletics
here?” asked Hugh. “He said something
that——”</p>

<p>“Chairman of the Faculty Athletic Committee,”
replied Nick. “He and Gring and Pete
Sargent are the committee. You must have made
a hit with him or he wouldn’t have gone to Dinny<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
with you. I like Smiles. Wish I was still taking
Latin.”</p>

<p>“I dare say it wouldn’t do you any harm,” said
Bert unkindly.</p>

<p>“Nor much good. All a fellow needs is
enough to pass his college exams. After that he
forgets it as fast as he knows how. Well, meanwhile
there’s a bunch of German waiting for me
downstairs. You’re a lucky dog not to have the
stuff, Bert.”</p>

<p>“I get it next year. What are you reading?”</p>

<p>“‘Das Edel Blüt.’ It’s tough, if you ask me.
When there was a perfectly good, gentlemanly
language like Latin, why did someone have to
go and invent German? Well, I’m off.”</p>

<p>Hugh was summoned to the office Thursday
and listened to a brief homily by Mr. Rumford.
When he emerged he was once more in good
standing. Since, however, it was by that time
almost five o’clock, it was too late to report to
Mr. Crowley that day, and Hugh dropped in on
Wallace Cathcart and spent the rest of the time
until supper arguing whether a college education
was essential to success in life. While Hugh
could beat his host at tennis, and had done it
twice since their first meeting, he was no match
for him in the present controversy, and Cathcart<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
won the debate easily, proving conclusively that
a high school education was all that was required
by the average person. And this in the face of
the fact that Cathcart had his plans all laid for
a full college course and two years of graduate
study!</p>

<p>Hugh reported to Mr. Crowley the next afternoon
dressed for play. The second team coach
viewed him with an unflattering lack of enthusiasm.
“Are you square with the office?” he asked.
Hugh assured him that he was. Mr. Crowley
glanced doubtfully about the field and then
grunted. “All right. Get in there and catch
some of those punts.” That was all. Evidently,
Hugh reflected, his advent was not a matter of
as much importance to Mr. Crowley as it was to
him.</p>

<p>His appearance with the squad aroused not a
little surprise among his team-mates. In one or
two cases, he thought, it aroused resentment as
well. He knew few of the fellows save by sight.
Neil Ayer, the first-choice quarter-back, was a
speaking acquaintance, and so, to a lesser extent,
was Hauser, who played left half. But the rest
were practically strangers to him. He was relieved
to find that his enforced idleness had not
cost him what skill he had acquired, and he
couldn’t see but that he caught, threw and handled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
the pigskin generally as well as half the fellows
in the squad. Mr. Crowley made him
known to Captain Myatt later, and Myatt, who
was a big, likable chap, won Hugh’s instant affection
by being very nice to him. One would have
thought from Myatt’s words that Hugh was
doing him the biggest sort of a favor by joining
the squad. Hugh didn’t get into signal work, for
he didn’t know the code, but he trudged along
behind and listened and watched and picked up a
good deal of useful knowledge that afternoon.
Later, when the second took the field to play two
ten-minute periods with the first, Hugh and three
others were sent off out of the way with a football
and put in the time punting and catching. At
supper time, armed with his napkin-ring and a
bottle of marmalade, his private property, he
joined the training table in Manning.</p>

<p>There were just twenty youths at the long table
which was set up in a corner of the big dining hall
in the junior dormitory, and Mr. Crowley presided
at the head. Hugh felt a bit strange at
supper that first evening and was conscious of the
puzzled regard of some of his companions.
Doubtless they wondered at his sudden advent
with the team. There was no ill-feeling in evidence,
however, and Hugh got through the meal
without much conversation and felt somewhat relieved<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
when chairs were pushed back. At training
table, in order that no one should hurry
through his meal at the risk of indigestion, it was
a rule that all must remain until the coach gave
the word. Consequently, if one did bolt his food
it profited him nothing since he was obliged to sit
there and watch his neighbors finish, and fellows
who had the “quick lunch” habit soon got over
it. Mr. Crowley made occasional exceptions to
the rule, but one had to put forward a pretty
convincing plea.</p>

<p>Tonight the team left the table together and
Hugh passed down the corridor in the rear of the
group. When he reached the entrance several of
the second team members had paused just outside
the doorway and Hugh’s passage was blocked.
After pausing an instant for the others to go on
down the steps or move aside, he said: “I beg
your pardon,” and edged through. A short,
broad-bodied youth glanced around and instantly
pulled a companion out of the way.</p>

<p>“Gangway, Charley!” he exclaimed. “Let the
British Aristocracy pass. My word, we fawncy
ourself a bit, eh, what?”</p>

<p>Hugh recognized the speaker as Brewster
Longley, the team’s center. He was broad of
shoulder and hip, short-necked and short-limbed,
with a round face surmounted by very black hair<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
which, close-cropped, looked like the bristles
of a blacking brush. He was called “Brew”
Longley and was a very clever center. Hugh’s
brief glance expressed surprise as he passed down
the steps. He had never spoken to Longley and
the latter’s unexpected “ragging” disconcerted
him. As he went off along the path he heard an
amused laugh from the occupants of the steps and
resented it. He had half a mind to turn back.
But the next instant his flash of anger left him
and he mentally shrugged his shoulders and dismissed
the incident.</p>

<p>Bert was not at home when Hugh reached the
study, but he came in soon after looking cross and
worried. Hugh’s efforts at conversation were not
successful, for Bert answered in monosyllables
and showed an evident disinclination to talk.
Animated by good resolutions regarding study,
for he meant to keep his present class standing if
it was possible and so follow the earnest advice
of Mr. Rumford, Hugh got his books together
and seated himself at his table. But it was hard
to get his mind on lessons when Bert was wandering
aimlessly from bedroom to study and from
study back to bedroom. Finally Hugh ventured
a good-natured protest and to his bewilderment
Bert turned on him angrily.</p>

<p>“Oh, dry up!” he snarled. “If you don’t like<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
my moving around you take your books in your
room. I’ve got as much right here as you
have.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say you hadn’t,” replied Hugh, after
the first moment of astonishment. “What are
you so waxy about? I only asked you not
to——”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll walk around here just as much as
I please,” growled the other. “You make me
weary, anyhow, you and your airs! I didn’t ask
to have a blooming Britisher wished on me, if
you care to know it!”</p>

<p>“And I didn’t ask to be put in with a bear,”
replied Hugh mildly. “What’s wrong with you,
anyhow, old chap? Anything I’ve done?”</p>

<p>“There isn’t anything wrong,” responded Bert
crossly, “except that a fellow likes a certain
amount of freedom in his own rooms. You seem
to think you own this place!”</p>

<p>“Piffle! Go ahead and walk if it does you any
good.” Hugh smiled as he turned back to his
book. Probably Bert was looking for grievances,
for that smile instead of bringing peace
produced a fresh outburst.</p>

<p>“You bet I’ll walk! And let me tell you another
thing, Ordway. I had this room picked
out long before you ever thought of coming here,
and if another chap hadn’t quit school you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
wouldn’t be here. Anyone would think from the
airs you put on that this dormitory was built
especially for you.”</p>

<p>“Then let me tell you something, Bert,” said
Hugh, losing patience at last. “My mother
wanted me to take this room by myself and she
engaged it last spring. Later the secretary wrote
that they had had another application for it and
would I mind sharing the suite. And I said I
wouldn’t, although the mater was dead against
it. So if you think I’m here through any kindness
of yours you’re all wrong.”</p>

<p>Bert stared in surprise. “I don’t believe it,”
he said at last. “They wouldn’t rent this suite
to one fellow. They never do.”</p>

<p>“They did, however. If you don’t believe me
I can show you the paper. It’s in my dispatch-box
in there. Mind you, I’m not fussing about it,
but I’m hanged if you can tell me I got in here
because you said so!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I suppose you’re such a swell they let
down the rules for you,” sneered Bert. “I dare
say they thought you were the Prince of Wales,
with your silly valet and your coat-of-arms and
all the rest of the piffle! You make me mighty
tired, if you want to know.”</p>

<p>“Sorry,” said Hugh shortly. “But I don’t
see what’s going to be done about it. I’m<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
plaguey sure I’m not going to get out of here to
oblige you, old chap.”</p>

<p>“All right, but as long as you stay you can be
mighty sure that I’m going to do as I please here,
you pig-headed Britisher!”</p>

<p>“Right-o! And now let’s stop chinning, if you
don’t mind.”</p>

<p>Bert grumbled a bit and at last, with a good
deal of noisy slamming of books, settled down
to study. They didn’t speak again that evening.
Later Bert took himself off to visit somewhere in
the building and Hugh went to bed with a book.
He didn’t read a great deal, though, for Bert’s
remarks had stung. When you are making a
hard try to be as American and democratic as
you possibly can, it is discouraging to be accused
of putting on side. In Hugh’s case it hurt. Looking
back, he could see now that he had made a
bad beginning by appearing on the scene with
Bowles in attendance, but he had supposed that
Bert and the others had forgotten that incident.
As for the coat-of-arms—what Bert really meant
was crest—that seemed a small matter. It was
on his brushes and silver toilet things, and he
had some writing paper that bore it. But he
never used the paper and he certainly never
paraded the toilet articles. After a while he
got out of bed, pulled his bag from the closet and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
ruthlessly dumped brushes and comb and shoehorn
and buttonhook and three or four other articles
into it and shoved the bag back in the closet.
The next morning he combed his hair with his fingers,
not very successfully, and after English he
hurried off to the village and outfitted anew at
the drug store, becoming the owner of two military
brushes with imitation mahogany backs, a
black rubber comb, a five-cent buttonhook made
of nickel, and a papier-mâché shoehorn. He
didn’t know what more he could do unless he gave
up wearing his watch, which had the crest above
his monogram, or left off a small seal-ring which
offended in the same way.</p>

<p>Bert had apparently forgotten his ill-humor of
the night before and was the same as usual, except
that he seemed rather quiet and depressed. Hugh,
however, found it hard to forget so readily, for
he was fond of his roommate and the latter’s remarks
still rankled. But Hugh tried to hide the
fact and Bert never suspected it. That afternoon
Hugh believed that he had discovered the reason
for his chum’s ill-humor, for Bert didn’t get into
the scrimmage with the second team until it was
almost over, Zanetti and Siedhof playing at left
half by turns. Hugh was again left out of the
second team line-up, but he was able to follow
the scrimmaging fairly closely from where he and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
three other fellows were punting and catching
beyond the west goal.</p>

<p>Later he walked back with Pop, and Pop, after
a silence that lasted until they had crossed the
green, asked: “What’s wrong with Bert, Duke?
He’s as grouchy as a bear and is playing like a
silly idiot. Bonner gave him an awful dressing-down
after practice yesterday. And of course
he had to go and lose his temper and sass Bonner
back and there was the dickens to pay for a while.
Bonner made him apologize. I was afraid at first
that Bert wouldn’t do it. Did he tell you about
it?”</p>

<p>“Not a word. He was beastly ugly last evening,
though. I didn’t know what the dickens was
up. We had a regular row.”</p>

<p>“He has a rotten temper. Gets over it quick,
though. I thought at one time Bonner was going
to fire him from the squad. He will have to brace
up and get onto himself or he will find that Siedhof
has his place. Bonner isn’t the sort you can
fool with much.”</p>

<p>“I wish he wouldn’t flare up the way he does,”
said Hugh. “He says perfectly rotten things
when he’s waxy.”</p>

<p>Pop nodded. “He’s as mean as a little yellow
pup when he gets started. Come on over a while,
Duke, and tell me how you’re getting on. What’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
Crowley going to do with you, by the way? The
end positions are settled, aren’t they?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but Bert thinks I might beat out that
chap Forbes. I dare say I’ll sit on the bench a
good deal, though. What sort of a team has
Rotan College, Pop?”</p>

<p>“‘Rotten’ College? Oh, good enough to lay
us out, I guess. They’ll win about twelve to nothing.
Still, it’ll be a good game. There’s a big
mucker named Lambert who plays left guard for
them. Lambert and I had quite a merry little
party last year and I’m honest enough to own up
that he got the best of it. I’m looking forward
with much pleasure to meeting him again on Saturday.”
Pop smiled grimly. “If he tries what
he tried last year he won’t play more than a couple
of periods, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Pop, you must control that horrid temper of
yours,” said Hugh gravely.</p>

<p>Pop grinned. “I will. I’m not going to start
anything, Duke, but if Lambert gets gay he will
run against something hard this time. Last year
I stood a lot of jolts from him, and Bonner saw
it, and after the game—they beat us seven to
three—he said, ‘If I had caught you slugging
back at that fellow I’d have pulled you out, Pop.’
‘Sure, I knew that,’ I told him. ‘That’s the only
reason he got away with it.’ So the other day<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
Bonner said, ‘You’ll play against Lambert again
next Saturday.’ And I said, yes, I was expecting
to. And Bonner said, looking away off into the
distance, ‘He used you sort of roughly last year,
didn’t he?’ ‘He sure did,’ said I. ‘Well, we
mustn’t have any rough stuff, Pop, you know. If
I catch you at it you’ll come out.’ ‘All right,’ said
I. ‘Are you likely to be looking?’ ‘Well, I’m
not going to keep my eyes on you all the time,’ he
said, ‘and my sight isn’t what it was when I was
younger, but if the umpire should call my attention
to anything you’d have to come out, Pop. So
if I were you I’d be a bit careful!’ And I’m going
to be.”</p>

<p>Hugh laughed as Pop pushed him through the
doorway of Number 20. “I’m not going to miss
that game, whatever happens,” he declared. “And
if they send me out to carry you off, Pop, I’ll be
very gentle with you.”</p>

<p>“Huh!” growled the other. “Carry <em>me</em> off,
eh? If Lambert doesn’t act like a perfect gentleman
he will be smiling in his sleep and listening
to the birdies singing about the middle of the
second quarter!”</p>

<small>BERT CONFIDES</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Bert wasn’t very good company that week.
In the evenings he made a great pretence
of studying, but Hugh’s stolen glances
showed that his friend’s thoughts were far from
his books. At times Bert was as gay as you
please, but the gayety didn’t last long and while
it did last struck Hugh as being decidedly forced.
For the most part Bert was silent and morose.
There were no more bickerings, but it was more
to Hugh’s credit than Bert’s, for the latter on
more than one occasion showed himself ready to
quarrel on any provocation. As a result Hugh
was less at home than usual. He spent much time
with Pop Driver and Roy Dresser, over in Trow,
and often dropped down the corridor to hobnob
with Cathcart before bedtime. There was one
good thing about the proctor and that was that
you could always depend on finding him in his
room except when he had a recitation. Now and
then Hugh visited Nick, but Nick, unlike Cathcart,
was almost never in. A couple of evenings<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
Hugh went over to Lit for awhile, but he had
a feeling that it was better taste to remain away
from the society’s room until he was a full-fledged
member. He very much wished that Bert would
confide in him, so that whatever the trouble was
they might talk it over like sensible beings. Somehow,
he didn’t believe that gridiron difficulties
quite explained his friend’s condition of mind.
Instead, he shrewdly suspected that Bert’s poor
performances in practice of late were the result
of some secret worry and not the cause of it. All
that Hugh could be certain of was that studies had
nothing to do with it, for, while Bert was not a
particularly studious fellow, he nevertheless managed
to maintain an average standing and was
seldom in trouble with the office.</p>

<p>Bert went back to left half on Wednesday and
stayed there until the Rotan game. But even
Hugh could see that he was having a hard time
of it to keep Siedhof out, and there were times
when no one could have criticized Coach Bonner
had he pulled Bert back to the bench. Nick confided
to Hugh one day that Bert was frightfully
off his game, adding regretfully, “It’s got so I
think twice before I give him the ball. And Bonner’s
getting on to me, too. Bert’s got to brace
up Saturday or Billy Siedhof will have his place.
I’d like to know what the dickens is wrong with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
him! The best thing for him would be to get
Davy to lay him off for three or four days. I
suggested it to him yesterday and he nearly bit
my head off. Ted’s got his eye on him, too, and
Ted’s so set on winning this year that he’d fire
his grandmother if she didn’t play well! Look
here, ’Ighness, why don’t you sort of drop a hint
to Bert, eh? I’ve tried it and only escaped death
by instant flight.”</p>

<p>“So you want me to die, eh? I’d do it, only—well,
Bert gets mad so easily now that it wouldn’t
be much good.”</p>

<p>“I guess it wouldn’t. Well, it’s his funeral and
he will have to make his own arrangements. Still,
I hate to see him making such a mess of things
without any reason that anyone can see. What
the dickens <em>is</em> the matter, Duke? Has he hinted
anything to you?”</p>

<p>“No, he hasn’t. All I know is——” Hugh
hesitated a moment. “I don’t <em>know</em> anything, but
this morning when I got the mail and took it up
there was a letter for Bert from his father—I
know the postmark and the writing, you see—and
one from Needham, and he didn’t like either
of them.”</p>

<p>“That isn’t much of a clue. He doesn’t like
anything just at present. He doesn’t even like
his fodder; doesn’t eat enough to keep alive. Oh,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
well, it will blow over, I guess. And I’ve got
enough to worry about as it is, with a left side of
the line that’s letting everything pile through it.
Saturday’s game is going to be a slaughter of the
innocents, Duke, you take it from me.”</p>

<p>Hugh, like Nick, had his own troubles during
the next few days, for Coach Crowley tried him
out at right end on the second, and as an end
Hugh had much to learn. Just why, after the
first ten-minute fiasco, Mr. Crowley sent him back
again Hugh couldn’t understand. Hugh was
boxed time after time, while the first team backs
romped past, allowed himself to be drawn out of
the play by the cunning Dresser until that youth
laughed when he caught Hugh’s anxious regard,
and twice overran the ball on kicks and felt like
forty kinds of a fool. But Crowley yanked him
hither and thither, bellowed things that he
couldn’t more than half understand, threatened
him with the bench regularly every second play—and
kept him at it. Hugh told himself Thursday
afternoon, as he made his way tiredly out of the
field house and back to Lothrop, that he had forever
settled his chances with the second and that
he was not half sorry. But later, when he had
eaten ravenously and rested, he decided that he
was sorry, awfully sorry, and he neglected his next
day’s Greek and mathematics while he frowningly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
studied a chapter entitled “How to Play the
End Positions” in a book on football. After a
half-hour of it he sighed and closed the volume.</p>

<p>“The chap who wrote that may know all about
it, but he doesn’t play Dinny’s kind of football,”
he reflected. “What I want is a book that will
tell me how to keep Roy and Franklin from making
me look like a guy! Still, I fancy Crowley
won’t try me there again unless both Forbes and
Bellows and that other chap get killed.”</p>

<p>But Hugh was wrong. The next day he was
again back at the right end of the line and again
Ayer yelped at him and Coach Crowley bellowed
and Captain Myatt barked. But he did a little
better today, just enough, probably, to keep Mr.
Crowley from having him instantly drawn and
quartered or immersed in boiling oil. Roy Dresser,
who played left end on the first, found it
harder to entice his opponent away from the play,
and Franklin, at left tackle, discovered that he
couldn’t always fool him. Still, Hugh missed an
easy tackle on one occasion and let Nick slip past
for a long gain while he ruefully picked himself
from the ground and scraped the mud from his
face. Mr. Crowley almost ate him for that and
Neil Ayer evinced every desire to officiate with the
vinegar and salt. That was a bad day for the
second, on the whole, for the first ran up five<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
scores in the twenty minutes of scrimmaging.
What troubled Hugh quite as much as his own
defects was the sorry performance put up by Bert
on the enemy team. Bert fumbled miserably
twice, and, while he usually gained when he had
the ball, played in such a half-hearted manner that
Coach Bonner was “on his neck” half the time.
In the last of the second period, when substitutions
on each team were numerous, Bert went out
in favor of Siedhof. Hugh, too, severed his connection
with the game then, and Forbes got back
to his own.</p>

<p>On the bench, dragging the sleeves of his
sweater across his chest, Hugh ventured a remark
to Bert, but the result was not encouraging. Bert
only growled. After that Hugh watched Forbes
and earnestly tried not to indulge in uncharitable
thoughts. But he couldn’t help feeling exultant
when Vail and Bert swept around their left end,
Vail carrying the pigskin, and spurned the recumbent
form of Forbes underfoot. That was encouraging
to Hugh. Even Forbes, it seemed, was
by no means beyond the cunning wiles of the
enemy. Then Davy Richards, the trainer, who
had been up the field administering to a dislocated
finger, hurried indignantly back to the bench and
sent them scurrying to the showers.</p>

<p>That evening Hugh went back to the football<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
book and discovered a trifle more of sense in what
he read. After all, he concluded, perhaps the
writer might last five minutes at end under Crowley.
There was no work for the first team regulars
on Friday, but the second-string players were
lined up against the second for one twelve-minute
period and barely saved their bacon by slipping
Derry across the field unnoticed for a forward
pass that brought a touchdown. Hugh congratulated
himself that that play took place on the
other side and that it was Bellows and not he
who had to face the irate Mr. Crowley. Three
minutes later, on the second’s thirty-five, first team
tried the same trick on the other side and Hugh
was fortunate enough to knock the ball down before
the opposing left end could get it. For that
he got a slap on the back from Myatt, a grin from
Quarterback Ayer, and a grunt from Coach Crowley.
Not much in the way of reward, perhaps,
after all the scoldings he had suffered, but quite
sufficient in Hugh’s estimation. Even though he
was informed a minute later that he was the worst
end that had ever donned canvas he refused to be
dejected. “That,” he told himself hearteningly
as he watched the opposing tackle and waited for
the signal, “isn’t so. If I were as bad as that I
wouldn’t be here.” Then he was trying to block
off a big tackle, while Ayer’s voice shrilled “<em>In!</em><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
<em>In!</em>” and everything was excitedly confused and
glorious. After another moment Hauser yanked
him to his feet at the risk of dislocating his arm
and Myatt shoved him into position again, and
Quinn was crying: “Third down! Four to go!”
and Ayer was barking his signals: “Manson
back! 47—35—16!”</p>

<p>The game ended when Manson’s punt had
dropped into the arms of a first-team back, and,
muddy and warm and panting, they trotted up to
the field house. It was worth all the hard knocks
and harder words to feel the tingling rain of the
hissing shower on naked body, and afterwards,
Hugh, deliciously weary, slowly pulled his clothes
on and went half asleep in the task of tying a
shoelace and heard the babel of voices as in a
dream until Ben Myatt, scantily wrapped in a
monstrous bath towel, sank to the bench beside
him with a deep sigh and murmured: “They
didn’t do much with our wing today, Ordway, did
they?”</p>

<p>And Hugh, emerging from his luxurious
drowse, shook his head proudly and answered:
“Rather not!” After which, with a supreme effort
of the will, he finished tying that lace and
got to his feet. Encountering the eyes of Forbes
he smiled kindly but pityingly. It was too bad
that Forbes was out of it. He was sorry for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
Forbes. But as events proved he need not have
been.</p>

<p>He found Bert lying on the window-seat scribbling
on a scratch-pad when he got back to Lothrop.
Perhaps the afternoon’s rest had benefited
the first-team player, for he was undeniably in
better humor.</p>

<p>“What did they do to you, Hugh?” he asked
as he tore a sheet from the pad and crumpled it
in his hand. “Were they brutal?”</p>

<p>“Hardly! They scored once, but they wouldn’t
have pulled that if we hadn’t been asleep. Derry
took a pass about a foot from the side line and
ran thirty yards.”</p>

<p>Bert laughed. “What were you fellows doing
to let him get off like that? You must have been
asleep!”</p>

<p>“I fancy we were,” acknowledged Hugh ruefully
as he seated himself in the Morris chair and
stretched tired legs across the rug. “I was awfully
glad it wasn’t on my side.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet you were! Who played halves for
them?”</p>

<p>“Kinds was one. The other fellow I don’t
know. Small and dark and awfully quick and
squirmy.”</p>

<p>“Fearing. He’s going to make a bully half
some day. He’s only a lower middler.” There<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
was a pause and then: “Say, Hugh,” Bert went
on carelessly, “you don’t happen to have any
money you don’t want to use for a while, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Money? How much?”</p>

<p>“Oh, a beast of a lot; thirty dollars. Twenty
would do, I guess. It would do for a while, anyway.”
Bert was much too casual to deceive the
other and Hugh looked regretful.</p>

<p>“No, I haven’t more than six or seven, Bert.
How soon would you have to have it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, it doesn’t matter. I only thought that if
you did happen to have it——”</p>

<p>“I know, but I fancy I could get it in a few
days. Only thing is the mater’s away just now.”
He frowned thoughtfully. “What are you going
to do, Bert? Buy something?”</p>

<p>“Sort of. It doesn’t matter a bit.” He yawned
elaborately, tossed aside the block of paper and
sat up. “I’d have to have it by Monday, anyway.
Thanks just the same.”</p>

<p>“Monday! But this is Friday, and——”</p>

<p>“I know. Don’t bother. I tell you it doesn’t
matter, Hugh.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but—if you want it—I say, now, I might
telegraph, eh? But I dare say you could get it
from home as soon as I could.”</p>

<p>“Well, the fact is——” Bert hesitated. “My<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
dad’s shut down on me and won’t send me a cent
beyond my allowance; and that’s only ten
a month. Of course, he will come around in time;
maybe in a month; but I’ve got to have—that is,
I—I need twenty or thirty right now. I’ve sort
of promised a man to let him have it Monday.
It—it’s a debt. An old one. Things I bought
last winter. Now he’s acting nasty and threatens
to go to faculty if I don’t settle up.”</p>

<p>“But I thought we weren’t allowed to have any
debts!”</p>

<p>Bert shrugged. “We aren’t supposed to, except
by special arrangement. But most every fellow
has things charged here in the village or over
in Needham. Of course you’re supposed to settle
at the end of term, and I meant to, but I was
hard up and couldn’t. This Shylock bothered me
all summer with bills and letters and things and
I told him I’d pay when I got back. Well, I tried
to, but dad got angry and said I was spending too
much money and I’d have to get along on my
allowance. And he told mother not to let me
have it. So it’s a rotten outlook. Of course, if
I can’t pay him right now, I can’t, and that’s all
there is to it. Only if he <em>should</em> go to Charlie
I’d get fired as quick as a wink.”</p>

<p>“That’s too bad,” said Hugh sympathetically.
“We’ll simply have to dig up the money somewhere.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
Toss me that block, will you? And your
pencil? Thanks. Now, let’s see. ‘Please send
six pounds’—no, ‘thirty dollars——’” Hugh nibbled
the pencil reflectively. “I’ve got about six
dollars, though, so I’ll just ask for twenty-five.
Thirty’s enough, old chap? You’re certain?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I don’t believe you’d better, Hugh.
I don’t know, after all, when I can pay it back.
Maybe not until Christmas. I always get some
extra money then. I guess Fallow and Turner
will wait.”</p>

<p>“But there’d be no hurry about paying it back,
Bert,” the other protested. “And my mother
won’t mind sending it the least bit. I haven’t
asked for any extra tin for a long time. You just
sit tight, old dear, and leave it to me. ‘Please
send twenty-five dollars at once. Important.
Well. Love.’ That ought to do it. I say,
though, maybe I’d better ask mother to telegraph
it, eh? Then she’d surely get it here by Monday.
Unless, that is, this doesn’t get to her in
time. You see, she went away to make some visits
the other day. She ought to be in Philadelphia
tomorrow, but if she stayed over in New York—I
fancy I’ll send a couple of these just to be on
the safe side. Bound to fetch her that way,
what?”</p>

<p>“It’s awfully decent of you,” said Bert gratefully.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
“Hope I’ll be able to do as much for you
some day.”</p>

<p>“I hope you won’t need to,” laughed Hugh.
“How do I get these off? I can telephone, can’t
I?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and they’ll charge it to the school and
you can settle with the office. I ought to offer to
pay them myself, Hugh, but I’m just about
strapped. You could add it to the rest, though.”</p>

<p>“Oh, rot! I’ll nip down and get them off now.
If mother gets one of these tomorrow morning
we might hear by afternoon, eh?”</p>

<p>When Hugh got back Bert was whistling merrily
in his room.</p>

<p>“They said they’d get them off right away,”
Hugh announced from the doorway. “So that’s
all right, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Bert. “And I hope—— Well,
anyway, I’m awfully much obliged, Hugh. To
tell the truth I’ve been scared to death for a week
for fear Fallow would turn up here at school.”</p>

<p>“Well, it won’t matter if he does now,” responded
Hugh cheerfully. “Is—is that what’s
been bothering you lately, old chap?”</p>

<p>Bert nodded. “Did you notice it?” he asked,
mildly surprised.</p>

<p>“Did I notice it? Well, rather! You’ve been
as—as grouchy as a bear.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span></p>

<p>“Have I?” asked the other penitently. “I
guess I have. I’m sorry, Hugh. I guess I was
particularly nasty the other night, wasn’t I?”</p>

<p>“Well, you weren’t exactly sweet-tempered,”
chuckled Hugh.</p>

<p>“I guess I was a regular beast. I wish you’d—er—forget
it.”</p>

<p>“All right. I fancy I lost my temper a bit
too.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean”—Bert spoke from behind a
towel—“what I said about rooming with you,
Hugh. I—I’m sorry I was such a cad.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t talk so sick,” muttered Hugh, backing
away from the door. “I didn’t pay any attention
to it. Now shut up. I’ve got to wash.”</p>

<small>GRAFTON SCORES</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">The second team were not exempted from
work on Saturday, rather to their annoyance,
and it wasn’t until the Rotan College
game was nearly half over that they were
dismissed and allowed to flock over to the first-team
gridiron and crowd into seats at the end of
the stand.</p>

<p>Rotan had already scored once and the board
announced “Grafton 0—Visitors 7.”</p>

<p>Rotan was a small college, but it rather specialized
in football and its teams were invariably
clever. Naturally the eleven blue-stockinged
youths averaged superior to Grafton in age, size,
weight and experience, and a defeat for the home
team was a foregone conclusion. Rotan had
played a mid-season contest at Grafton regularly
every fall for six years, and in that period Grafton’s
best performance was a 0 to 0 game four
years previous. Rotan was a light team, as college
teams went, but it knew a lot of football and
provided just the experience that Coach Bonner<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
desired for his charges at that period of development.</p>

<p>It was soon apparent to the second team members
that their champions were in for a severe
drubbing today. Rotan was using a wide-open
formation and running her backs around the Grafton
wings about as she pleased, varying this
pastime by an occasional short punt and a quarter-back
plunge at the center. The Rotan backs were
tall and heavy and hard to stop even when the
home-team players were fortunate enough to get
to them. But it was the dazzling unexpectedness
of the attack that was principally accountable
for the helplessness of the Scarlet-and-Gray. Rotan’s
forwards would string across the field almost
from side line to side line, her backs would retreat
ten and even twelve yards behind them, there
would come a quick, short signal, the ball would
go back, the back-field would start on the run
to one side or the other, the ball would be caught
by one or another of the moving backs, Grafton
would come plunging through and then—well,
then a blue-armed youth would be suddenly seen
running blithely away with the pigskin tucked to
his body and not a Graftonian nearer than five
yards! How they did it not even the spectators
could see. They seemed to possess an absolutely
uncanny ability to guess where the openings were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
to be. Hanser, who was Hugh’s neighbor on one
side, muttered disgustedly when a Rotan half had
taken the ball over three white lines and placed it
twenty yards from the home team’s goal.</p>

<p>“Why doesn’t Ted play his ends deeper?” he
asked. “What’s the idea of tearing through and
not knowing where the ball is? They can’t stop
’em that way. What’s Bonner thinking of, I’d
like to know.”</p>

<p>“It looks to me,” said Bellows, from further
along, “as if those fellows started before the ball.
You watch this time, Frank.”</p>

<p>“I have watched, and they don’t. They’ve got
it down pretty fine, that’s all. That full-back does
start before the ball, but he runs back a little and
he’s all right. Then when the ball is snapped he
straightens out again and half the time he
doesn’t get into the play at all. If one of those
chaps would only fumble once it would be a
cinch!”</p>

<p>“They won’t, though. They’re wizards at it.
Watch the way they put Kinley out every time.
Musgrave too.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and look at our ends. Might as well be
sitting on the bench for all the good they do. If
I was Ted I’d close the line up and make them
show their hand more. That was Neil Ayer.
They’ll have to quit that foolishness now, though.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
They won’t be able to run the ends inside the
twenty.”</p>

<p>Rotan didn’t try to. She closed up and piled
her backs at the left of the Grafton line and made
three past Kinley and Franklin. She repeated the
play for two more and then tried a skin-tackle
play off Ted Trafford that worked for a scant
yard. With four to go on fourth down her full-back
dropped behind to the thirty yards and held
his long arms out. But he didn’t kick when the
ball came to him. Instead, there was a straight
heave across the center and for a breathless instant
it seemed that the visitors had again scored.
But the end, who had managed to post himself
behind the goal line, couldn’t hold the ball when
it came to him and the pigskin changed hands.</p>

<p>Hugh watched interestedly then to see how Pop
Driver and the redoubtable Lambert were getting
on. But the play was at the far end of the field
and details were beyond his vision. Two tries
netted the Scarlet-and-Gray less than five yards
and Keyes punted high and far. Roy Dresser
nailed the Rotan quarter on the enemy’s thirty-eight
and once more Rotan started her open
game. Four yards, eight yards, six yards, and the
linesmen scampered with the chain. So far Rotan
had not once tried a forward pass in the middle
of the field, but when two tries netted but seven<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
yards, she gave a remarkable exhibition of her
ability in that department. The full-back went
back to kicking position and the ball sped fast
and true to him. Then, with two backs forming
a tandem interference, he sped to the left. Tray,
the Grafton right end, failed to get through and
it was Ted Trafford who almost upset the runner
well behind his line. But Ted’s tackle just failed
and the full-back stopped short, turned and heaved
the pigskin far down the field and to the right,
where his own right end, quite uncovered, was
waiting. Nick Blake brought down the runner
on his thirty-six yards and won a salvo of applause.
But after that there was no hope. Rotan
snaked through the Grafton left side, ran both
ends, faked two kicks, and finally, when the defenders
fully expected a forward pass, massed on
the center of the line and piled through Musgrave
for the second touchdown. Rotan failed at goal
and a moment later the half was at an end.</p>

<p>“Thirteen to nothing, eh?” muttered Hanser,
his eyes on the scoreboard. “I guess I can pretty
nearly predict the final score, Ordway. About
thirty-two to a goose-egg, I reckon. Rotan ought
to be able to score three more touchdowns and
kick at least one goal.”</p>

<p>“Maybe we’ll buck up in the next half,” said
Hugh hopefully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span></p>

<p>“We’ll have to do a lot of bucking,” grunted
Hanser as he pulled himself from the seat. “I’m
going down to look for a fellow. Keep my seat,
will you?”</p>

<p>School and village had turned out well for
the game, and Rotan had brought some half-hundred
students with her, and so between halves
there was a good deal of cheering from both
sides of the field, and the visiting contingent sang
a couple of songs and were politely applauded.
Then Hanser ploughed his way back to his seat,
the teams trotted around the corner of the stand
and Rotan lined up for the kick-off.</p>

<p>Bert Winslow, playing back with Nick, caught
the ball and ran it a good twelve yards before he
was spilled. Then Grafton, evidently smarting
under the coach’s remarks in the field house, went
at it with a new vim. Unable in the first half to
make much headway through the blue line, she
began to bear down hard on the ends and tackles.
The first attempt gained many yards, but it was
across the field instead of down it, and the pigskin
came to a pause on the same line from which
it had started. But the next attempt proved more
successful, for, with Keyes carrying, the pigskin
slipped around the Rotan left end for a first
down. Then Bert plowed through between center
and right guard for four and Roy Dresser,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
on an end-around play, added another five. Keyes
plugged through on the left for enough to make
the distance. By this time Grafton was shouting
enthusiastically in the stand and the ball was
past the center of the field and in Rotan territory.</p>

<p>Bert again made four on a delayed pass around
the opponent’s right wing, and once more Keyes,
from kick formation, ran wide for a scant gain.
With four to go, Nick slipped straight ahead for
two and then Keyes faked a kick and made it
first down. The ball was near Rotan thirty-five
yards now and visions of a touchdown floated before
the Grafton supporters. But when two tries
had failed to yield more than four yards and
Keyes got a forward pass away to Roy Dresser
and that youth failed even to touch it, a punt was
in order. Rotan caught on her five yards but
failed to gain. Then, since the play was now
nearly opposite his end of the stand, Hugh could
watch the doings of Pop and his adversary. And
they were well worth noting.</p>

<p>Lambert was a big, rawboned fellow with a
shock of yellow-brown hair which, since he had
lost his head-guard, made a vivid note of color.
It was evident to Hugh that both Pop and Lambert
were engaged in a private and personal rivalry
that was of absorbing interest to them.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
And both youths looked as if they had had hard
wear. Lambert sported a strip of plaster across
his nose like a saddle and Pop had one very discolored
eye. On offense Lambert played well outside
of Pop Driver, for the Grafton line was no
longer attempting to stretch as wide as the opponent’s,
and, theoretically at least, it was Captain
Trafford who should have engaged the shock-haired
left guard. But Hugh noted with amusement
that almost every time it was Pop who tried
conclusions with Lambert, often, as it appeared,
most impolitely ignoring the center’s efforts to
interest him. Hugh couldn’t see anything that
looked like slugging, however, in spite of the
visible marks of combat. It was merely a very
pretty struggle for supremacy, with the honors
fairly even, Hugh concluded. But a few minutes
later, when Rotan, having failed at a run around
Roy Dresser’s end and lost three yards on a forward
pass that went awry, finally punted to
midfield and the two teams lined up close to the
fifty-yard line, he began to have his doubts. With
the ball in Grafton’s possession and the lines playing
close and compact, Lambert and Pop faced
each other at arm’s length. On the first play, a direct
plunge at the guard position on the left, Hugh,
watching Pop and his adversary rather than the
runner, saw the rivals clash together and Lambert’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
fist, under cover of the confusion, jerk
upwards to Pop’s chin. He almost, he thought,
heard the thud of the blow. He saw Pop’s head
go back and Pop reel for an instant. Then the
Rotan line buckled and the whistle shrilled. Hugh
turned to Hanser, but it was evident that the
incident had escaped him just as it had apparently
escaped everyone else, including the officials.</p>

<p>“That chap Lambert there is slugging like the
mischief,” said Hugh.</p>

<p>“Is he?” Hanser chuckled. “He’d better not
try it on with Pop Driver, then. Pop’s sore with
him, anyway, after last year’s game.”</p>

<p>“I fancy he’s sorer now,” replied Hugh dryly,
“for Lambert just drove his fist under Pop’s
chin.”</p>

<p>“Lambert did?” asked Hanser incredulously.
“Did you see him?”</p>

<p>“Rather!”</p>

<p>“Then it’s good-by, Lambert, all right, all
right! Pop’ll get him before long.”</p>

<p>But the next play drew Pop further out and set
him to boxing the opposing tackle, and he and
Lambert didn’t get together. Grafton lost on an
attempt at a skin-tackle play and Keyes went back
to kicking position. When the ball was passed
from center Pop met the onslaught of Lambert
with all the weight of his body and bore him back<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
far behind his own line, to the annoyance of Lambert
and the amusement of those who watched.
When the ball was sailing down the field Lambert
was still giving ground before Pop. Infuriated,
he drew back his arm as they separated
and aimed a blow. But Pop ducked inside his
guard and Lambert’s fist shot harmlessly into air.
For the space of two or three seconds the two
players stood there, their faces close, and Hugh
could see Pop’s lips move. Then, as a Rotan
player shoved in between them, Pop drew off and
trotted down the field. Hugh wondered what he
had said to Lambert.</p>

<p>Rotan came back with a vengeance and eight
plays put the pigskin back where it had been.
Then another long forward pass was successful
and once more Grafton was defending her last
ditch. This time the enemy had harder work
getting across that last line, but cross it she did
eventually, her full-back dragging half the defending
team with him as he won the final three
yards on a plunge through Yetter, who had taken
Kinley’s place at left guard. It was a fine mêlée,
that play, a confused jumble of writhing, pushing,
panting bodies, and when the whistle blew half the
twenty-two contestants were heaped in a gorgeous
pyramid above the ball. One by one they were
pulled to their feet while the referee squirmed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
under the pile and located the pigskin a good six
inches past the line. But they didn’t all get up,
either, for one player with blue-stockinged legs
remained prone on the trampled sod, and when,
a moment later, they raised his head and swashed
the big sponge over his face Hugh caught sight
of a mass of yellow-brown hair.</p>

<p>“It’s Lambert!” he said awedly.</p>

<p>Hanser nodded. “I told you Pop would get
him,” he replied. “You can’t put your fist in
Pop’s face like that and get away with it—not
unless you smile when you do it! I guess Lambert’s
through. Yes, there he goes. Looks a bit
groggy, doesn’t he? And unless I’m mistaken
he’s wondering whether the goal post fell on him
or he was trampled by a stone-crusher.” Hanser
chuckled. “He just tried it once too often, that’s
all.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t see anything,” said Hugh wonderingly.</p>

<p>“Nor anyone else, I guess, except Lambert,
and he saw stars. Pop waited until he could do
it right and get away with it. If Pop handed him
one you can bet he deserved it, for Pop Driver’s
as clean a player as there is.”</p>

<p>Lambert, supported by a team-mate, was walking
off the field, his legs decidedly wobbly and his
head showing an inclination to fall over on his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
chest, and a substitute was being sent in. Then
Rotan punted out, caught neatly, and sent a clean
kick over the bar for another point, and the scoreboard
changed its figures to 20.</p>

<p>There was no more scoring in that period and
none in the last until well toward the end. Coach
Bonner had sprinkled substitutes liberally by that
time, and Rotan, too, was represented by a number
of second-string players. The visitor evidently
concluded that she had piled up a sufficient
score and was bent only on holding her adversary
where she was. She punted on second down frequently
and managed to keep the ball in Grafton
territory until there were but six minutes left to
play. Then a fumble by a substitute Rotan half-back
changed the complexion of affairs, for
Parker, who had taken Franklin’s place at left
tackle, shot through and dropped on the pigskin
and it was Grafton’s on the enemy’s thirty-two
yards!</p>

<p>Weston, second-choice quarter, dashed on with
instructions and Nick Blake yielded his head-guard
and trotted off. In the stands, Grafton
sympathizers demanded a touchdown. The Scarlet-and-Gray
began an attack on the left of the
Rotan center, where Lambert had yielded to a
substitute, and first Keyes and then Bert and Vail
tore through for short but substantial gains.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
Down to the twenty yards went the ball, Rotan
hurrying on two fresh players to bolster her line.
A forward pass gained four yards and Bert got
six past left tackle. Weston carried the ball on
a delayed play straight through center for three
more. But on her seven yards, under the shadow
of her goal, Rotan stiffened. Two plunges at the
left gained little, for the secondary defense
stopped the runner in each case, and Keyes
dropped back to kick. Everything favored a
score then, but luck was against the home team,
for Musgrave passed miserably and all Keyes
could do was make the catch safe and try to gain
a scant two or three yards before the enemy
bowled him over.</p>

<p>It was fourth down now, with twelve to go,
and, after a hurried conference, Weston again
sent Keyes back. But although a try-at-goal was
to be expected, Rotan was not to be caught napping,
and she placed her back-field players to
guard against a forward pass. But the ball never
reached Keyes. Instead, it slanted off to Bert
and, while the big full-back gave a clever exhibition
of a youth kicking an imaginary pigskin,
Bert circled wide to his right, Vail leading the
way, and turned in sharply where Tray had
cleared the hole. There was an instant of doubt,
for a Rotan back dived for the runner and almost<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
stopped him, but Bert squirmed on, wrested himself
free, crossed the five-yard line unchallenged,
and plunged on in a confused medley of friends
and foes. He was almost across when the Rotan
quarter-back smashed into him. Bert faltered
then and gave back, but the next instant the drive
behind him carried him on again above the enemy
and buried him from sight well over the goal line.</p>

<p>Grafton waved and shouted and exulted, and
continued to shout until Weston was lying on the
sod with the ball between his hands and Keyes
was cautiously measuring the distance and studying
the cant. And afterwards, when the ball had
slanted off at a weird tangent, avoiding the goal
widely, Grafton shouted again, for what mattered
it if Keyes had missed? They had scored on
Rotan, scored against a far bigger and more experienced
team, and the figures on the score-board
were 6 and 20!</p>

<p>Something that did matter, however, although
few paid heed to it just then, was the fact that
Bert had laid where he had fallen until Davy,
beckoning two substitutes from the bench, had
had him borne away to the field house.</p>

<small>A BROKEN RIB</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">On the whole, Grafton was satisfied with
that game. She had made larger scores
against Rotan in the past, to be sure,
but on those occasions the college team had been
undoubtedly weaker than she had been today.
Even Coach Bonner, who was not easily satisfied,
acknowledged to Ted Trafford that the Scarlet-and-Gray
eleven had done well to hold Rotan
to three scores. Ted wanted credit, too, for the
six points his team had won, but Mr. Bonner
shrugged his shoulders then. “There was too
much luck in that touchdown, Traf,” he said.
“Defensively the team did very well. Let it go
at that!”</p>

<p>Hugh climbed the stairs to the infirmary
on the second floor of Manning after supper
that night to inquire about Bert, as to whose
injury many and various rumors were afloat.
Mrs. Prouty, the matron, gave him permission
to see the patient and Hugh found the invalid<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
in the act of finishing a fairly substantial
meal. Bert greeted the caller quite cheerfully.</p>

<p>“You needn’t tiptoe,” he laughed, “and you
needn’t look like an undertaker. I’m not dead
yet, Duke. It’s only a cracked rib. The Doc
says I’ll be all right in a couple of weeks and can
play before that if I’ll wear a pad. Still, it’s
kind of tough luck.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad it’s no worse,” said Hugh. “They
had all sorts of stories about you at table tonight.
You played a ripping—a corking game,
old chap.”</p>

<p>“Well, I played better than I’ve been playing,
that’s sure. It was a dandy game and we did
mighty well to hold them to twenty, Hugh, to
say nothing of scoring on them. Have you heard
yet?”</p>

<p>“Heard?” asked Hugh.</p>

<p>“About the money, I mean.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I say, I forgot all about it! There wasn’t
anything in the box, though. Would they put
a telegram in the box?”</p>

<p>“They usually telephone it to you. Maybe
your mother didn’t get your message in time,
though. You think she’s at either one of those
places, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes. I ought to have received a letter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
from her today. She almost always writes so that
I get it Saturday. We’ll surely hear by Monday,
Bert.”</p>

<p>“Well, I hope so. If that fellow wants to
make trouble for me he can do it to the King’s
taste.”</p>

<p>“He won’t, though, if he knows he’s going to
get his money, eh? You sit tight, old chap, and
don’t worry.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m tight, all right,” answered Bert, with
a grin. “They’ve got me strapped and plastered
and bandaged until I can hardly breathe! I’m
coming back Monday; Doc said I might. This
isn’t so bad, though, and Mother Prouty’s a
corker.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got it all to yourself, haven’t you?”
asked Hugh, viewing the two empty cots. “If you
get lonesome I’ll develop a mysterious illness and
get lugged over here. I dare say I’d better be
toddling along now, though. Do they let you
read?”</p>

<p>“Why not? I don’t have to use my ribs to
read, do I? By the way, I wish you’d drop
around tomorrow morning and bring my geometry
and Greek reader. And you might fetch a paper,
too. Good night.”</p>

<p>In the corridor below Hugh encountered Pop,
a rather damaged looking Pop, with a puffy green<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
and purple left eye and a long scratch on his
nose. When he learned that Hugh had just come
from the infirmary he turned back.</p>

<p>“I guess I won’t go up then,” he said. “How
is he? What’s the damage?”</p>

<p>Hugh told him as they left the building and
turned their steps toward Trow, and Pop expressed
relief. “Some fellow said he’d broken
his collar-bone. A rib isn’t so bad. Davy’ll have
him bundled up and playing in a few days. What
did you think of the game?”</p>

<p>“A little bit of all right, Pop! And, I say,
you certainly did for Lambert, what?”</p>

<p>“Lambert? No.”</p>

<p>Hugh laughed. “Oh, no; you didn’t wallop
the beggar, not half! Served him jolly right, of
course; I saw him give you that punch under the
chin, you know. I wish, though, you’d tell me
what you said to him that time you two had your
heads together.”</p>

<p>“Do you? Well, I said, ‘Lambert, if you
make me lose my temper you’ll go home in an
ambulance. Now quit it!’ He did, too. We
didn’t have any trouble after that.”</p>

<p>“You mean you didn’t! <em>He</em> looked jolly well
troubled when they took him off. Hanser said
you’d get him.”</p>

<p>“Sorry to disappoint Hanser,” replied Pop,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
“but as a matter of fact I didn’t mix it up with
Lambert once.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t? Then what happened to him?”</p>

<p>“He told me afterwards—I saw him in the
field house—that someone kicked him in the head.
He had rather a bad bruise.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” murmured Hugh. “Well, I fancied—you
know you said——”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know I did. But I got to thinking it
over. You see, I wanted to play the game
through, for one thing, and if I’d been caught
slugging I wouldn’t have. And then, too, I—well,
I sort of wanted to see if I <em>could</em> keep my
temper. After all, I guess the rough-stuff doesn’t
get you anything.”</p>

<p>“Rather looks as though Hanser and I misjudged
you, Pop,” laughed Hugh. Then, soberly:
“I say, though, I’m rather glad you didn’t.
Of course he deserved something, but—somehow—if
you know what I mean——”</p>

<p>“I get you, Steve! As you’d probably say, it
isn’t cricket. Coming up?”</p>

<p>“Thanks, no, not tonight. I’m rather keen on
writing a letter to the governor. Good night,
Pop.”</p>

<p>The letter wasn’t written until the next day,
though, for Cathcart dropped in to inquire after
Bert and remained to talk awhile, and before he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
left Nick and Guy arrived on a similar mission.
Nick was in extremely high spirits, in spite of the
fact that two of his fingers were bound together
with surgeon’s tape, and, after Cathcart had removed
his restraining presence, became so hilarious
and playful that Guy and Hugh were forced
to improvise a straight-jacket from a pair of
Bert’s discarded football pants. Subsequently,
Nick reclined, neatly trussed, on the window-seat
and proclaimed: “I am but mad north-northwest:
when the wind is southerly I know a hawk from
a handsaw!” Then he began on Hood’s “The
Bridge of Sighs,” and, reaching the lines,</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Mad from life’s history,</div>

    <div class="verse indent1">Anywhere, anywhere,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Out of the world!”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noi">he rolled himself off the cushion and reached the
floor with a most terrific bump. After that they
gagged him and sat on him.</p>

<p>Sunday turned out frosty and clear, with a
blue, blue sky overhead and scarlet and russet
leaves rustling along the paths. In the afternoon
Hugh and Pop ascended Mount Grafton to the
observatory on top and held their caps while they
climbed the winding stairway and looked for miles<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
over the world. Then they found a sunny crevice
in the great pink granite ledge beneath and sat
there for a long time, looking down on the roofs
of the school buildings below them, and discussed
many weighty matters. It was not until, comfortably
tired and very hungry, they returned to
school that Hugh got that letter written. When
he had finished it, however, and it lay sealed
and addressed on the table, instead of taking it
downstairs and dropping it in the mail-box he
slipped it between the leaves of a book and put
the book in the table drawer. In the morning he
would hand the letter directly to the postman, a
custom that puzzled Bert and moved him to sarcasm.</p>

<p>There was no reply to his telegram the next
forenoon and Hugh was troubled on Bert’s account.
The latter moved back to Lothrop and
attended classes as usual that morning, but, perhaps
because he was uncomfortably bandaged and
it hurt him when he took a deep breath, or perhaps
because he was worried over the non-arrival
of that money-order, he was in rather a cantankerous
mood. Hugh dispatched another message to
his mother before he went to the field in the afternoon,
addressing it to his home on the chance that
she had changed her plans and returned to Shorefields.
Fortunately, no irate creditor put in an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
appearance, and Bert took hope and accompanied
Hugh to the field to watch practice.</p>

<p>Hugh found a surprise awaiting him. They
had, it seemed, transferred Hanser to the first
team and, since that left the second long on ends
and short on half-backs, Hugh was informed that
he was to substitute Brunswick or Peet behind
the line. “Never played half, have you?” inquired
Mr. Crowley brusquely. “Thought not.
Well, keep your eyes open and study the signals.
You’re likely to get a chance to show what you
can do today or tomorrow.”</p>

<p>The chance came that afternoon, for Peet, who
had taken Hanser’s place, failed to satisfy the
coach and was pulled out five minutes after the
game with the first team began. Hugh, watching
Mr. Crowley anxiously, was half inclined to hope
that his choice would fall on the other substitute,
Boynton, for Hugh wasn’t at all convinced of his
ability to play half-back. Possibly, however, the
coach wanted to know just how bad Hugh would
prove, for after a quick glance along the bench he
motioned to him.</p>

<p>“Hi, Ordway! Get in there at right half.
Use your head, now, and don’t ball up your signals.
Tell Ayer to watch their guard-tackle hole
on the left. Get it? On the <em>left</em>!”</p>

<p>Well, on the whole, or “taking it by and large,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
as Pop would have said, Hugh didn’t do so badly
that afternoon. He did get his signals mixed
once and he soon proved himself much too light
for line-bucking. But on several occasions when
the play was outside of tackle he made good
gains, once reeling off fifteen yards before he was
thumped to the ground by Vail. And on defense
he rather did himself proud, working very
smoothly with Forbes, who was back at right
end, and Spalding, the right tackle, when the play
came that way. He made the mistakes of ignorance
and he once fumbled a two-yard pass from
the quarter, saving the situation, however, by
recovering the ball for a slight loss of ground.
Mr. Crowley cornered him in the dressing room
after practice and told him of a great many things
that he had done wrong and advised him to brush
up on the signals. And when the coach had taken
himself off, growling, Captain Myatt salved his
wounds with a smile and a “Good work, Ordway!
Hang to it!”</p>

<p>There was one thing that that afternoon’s experience
did for Hugh, in any event. It convinced
him that he didn’t want to play end again
and that he did want to play half-back. He would
go on being an end this year, he told himself, but
next fall he would go out for a half-back position
and refuse anything else. Playing end wasn’t bad<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
fun, but there was something about having the
ball in the crook of your elbow or snuggled to
your stomach and pitting your wits and speed and
strength against the enemy, that was ten times
more exciting. Of course, as soon as Bert got
into harness again Hanser would be returned to
the second and Hugh would be back elbowing
Forbes for the outpost position. But next
year!</p>

<p>He said all this to Bert that evening, being far
too full of the afternoon’s adventure to want to
study, and Bert, while granting that there was
no comparison in his mind between playing half-back
and end, advised Hugh to stick to his trade.
“You didn’t do half badly, Duke, for you’re certainly
just about as quick as they make ’em. Sort
of reminded me today of a cat, the way you
jumped off and squirmed around there. But
you’re not heavy enough to keep going, you see.
It’s the foot or two feet or yard that a fellow
makes after he’s tackled that counts. If it was
all around-the-end work you’d be rather a star,
but it isn’t. Down near goal you’d have to put
your head down and buck the line, old man. And
someone like Ted or Musgrave would stop you
so soon you’d go backward. You stick to being
a good end, at least until you’ve put on weight and
grown a bit.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span></p>

<p>“I say, I’m not so awfully much smaller than
you are,” protested Hugh.</p>

<p>“You’re twenty pounds lighter than I am, at
least, and you’re fully two inches shorter. You—you’ve
got to have punch when you go into the
line, Hugh. See what I mean?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I see what you mean,” responded the
other slowly, “but that chap Zanetti isn’t awfully
big and heavy, is he? And he played a mighty
good game today when he was in.”</p>

<p>“Jack Zanetti’s been at it four years, and he
knows how to use what weight he has got. So
will you when you’ve been playing that long.
Now dry up and let me bone this beastly French
rot. You’re worse than a magpie!”</p>

<p>“All right, old dear. But, I say, Bert, do you
think that by next year——”</p>

<p>“For the love of mud, shut up! I want to get
this done and hit the hay. If you had a rib that
hurt like the dickens every time you moved or
took a breath——”</p>

<p>Bert subsided with mutters and silence reigned.</p>

</div>


<p class="cap">Again, on Tuesday morning, there was no
telegram, and when Hugh, at Bert’s suggestion,
called up the telegraph office in
the village he was informed that no message addressed
to him had been received. Hugh was
by now at a loss to explain his mother’s silence
and Bert was anxious and a little bit unpleasant,
intimating that Hugh had promised more than he
could perform.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry I put you to so much trouble,” he
said stiffly. “If I’d known, I might have got hold
of the money somewhere else, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t put me to any trouble, Bert, and
I don’t understand why my mother hasn’t answered.
The only explanation I can think of is
that she has sort of dodged those telegrams, if
you know what I mean. She might have left
New York before the one I sent there was delivered
and gone back to Shorefields. Then she
may have gone to Philadelphia Sunday——”</p>

<p>“I should think she’d stay in one place a minute,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
Bert complained. “Of course, if Fallow
doesn’t come nosing around here before——”</p>

<p>“I say, I might send a message to Bowles, eh?
Tell him to wire mother’s present address. I’ll
do it at noon if we don’t hear before that. But
it certainly does seem as if mother must have got
one of my telegrams by this time!”</p>

<p>Bert couldn’t suggest anything better to do, and
they went across to School Hall for English 4.
It was a full morning for them both and neither
had time to think a great deal about that telegram
until they were through with Greek at twelve.
Then Hugh again called up the telegraph office,
received the same answer to his inquiry, and forthwith
dispatched a message to Bowles at Shorefields,
demanding an instant answer.</p>

<p>“That ought to be delivered by two o’clock,”
said Hugh, “and if he answers right away we
should hear by four.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right as long as Fallow doesn’t take
it into his head to come over here and raise a row
today. I promised I’d settle up with him yesterday,
you see. Maybe he will give me another day
or two, though. He would, don’t you think?”</p>

<p>“I’d say he should let you know before he went
to faculty about it,” said Hugh. “If he sits tight
until tomorrow I dare say we’ll have the coin for
him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span></p>

<p>“That’s what we thought Saturday,” responded
Bert morosely. “Well, we can’t do anything now
but wait and see what happens, I guess. I’m going
to dinner.”</p>

<p>Hugh had a conference with Mr. Rumford at
two-thirty and when he got back to Lothrop it
was nearly half-past three and Bert had gone
down to the field. Hugh dumped his books,
paused to scribble a memorandum, and then,
changing coat and waistcoat for a sweater, started
for the door. Simultaneously there was a knock
on the half-opened portal and Hugh swung it
open, revealing on the threshold a very stout man
with very red cheeks and a very luxuriant mustache.
That mustache so fascinated Hugh for a
moment that he merely stood there and gazed.
It was extremely black and it stuck out two or
three inches on each side of a big, round face.
Hugh wondered if it was real. Then the visitor
spoke and Hugh realized that he had been rudely
staring for several seconds.</p>

<p>“Mr. Winslow live here?” asked the caller in
a voice that seemed to come from well down toward
the lower button of the black-and-white
plaid waistcoat.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.” Hugh removed his gaze from the
mustache with difficulty. The man moved forward
and Hugh drew aside. By that time his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
wits were at work and he closed the door behind
the visitor. “Sit down, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” rumbled the man. “My name’s
Fallow; Fallow and Turner, over to Needham.
Guess you know me, eh? Or ain’t you Winslow?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Fallow? Oh, yes, to be sure. I—I’ve
heard of you, Mr. Fallow.”</p>

<p>“Guess you have,” said Mr. Fallow dryly. “A
good many times. Well, what’s the verdict?”</p>

<p>“Why—er—I say, take a seat, won’t you?
Try the big chair there. Now, sir, what can I
do for you?”</p>

<p>For answer Mr. Fallow, grunting, plunged a
hand inside his coat and drew forth a folded
paper which he waved slowly in front of him.</p>

<p>“For me?” asked Hugh interestedly. “What—is
it?”</p>

<p>“Say, you’re a cool one,” remarked the visitor
in unwilling admiration. “Bless me if you ain’t.
Well, this is a bill for thirty-four dollars and sixty
cents, son. I ought to add interest to it, too, I
guess, but I ain’t aiming to be hard on you. You
all ready to pay it?”</p>

<p>Hugh shook his head regretfully. “I’m sorry
to say I’m not, sir.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you ain’t?”</p>

<p>“No. You see, Mr. Fallow, I’ve been expecting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
some money ever since Saturday and it hasn’t
come. I’m awfully sorry. It’s sure to be here
tomorrow and——”</p>

<p>“Now look here, you!” Mr. Fallow scowled
darkly. “That’s the same song-and-dance you’ve
been giving me ever since last spring, and I’m sick
of it. I ain’t in business for my health!”</p>

<p>“Certainly not, sir. Not that you don’t look
jolly healthy, of course, but——”</p>

<p>“Say, don’t get fresh,” growled the other.
“Never you mind how I look. All you got to
do is to hand over my money. If you can’t do
that——”</p>

<p>“But I can, sir, only I can’t do it today. Tomorrow——”</p>

<p>“Yah! You promised it yesterday, didn’t you?
Well, I expect folks to keep their word, see? Tomorrow
won’t do, son. You’ve had time enough.”
He looked about the room sarcastically. “Living
in quarters like these, eh, and can’t pay your just
debts! Well, we’ll see what Mr. Thingamabob,
your principal, has got to say about it.” Mr.
Fallow stood up and with difficulty thrust the bill
back into his pocket.</p>

<p>“But, I say,” exclaimed Hugh in alarm, “you’re
not really going to do that?”</p>

<p>“You watch me!”</p>

<p>“Well, but—I say, now, look here a sec! I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
give you my word that bill will be paid this week,
and——”</p>

<p>“You said tomorrow.”</p>

<p>“I’m almost certain it will be tomorrow, but
my—my mother is away from home and I fancy
she hasn’t got my telegram, don’t you know.”</p>

<p>“Well, tomorrow ain’t going to do—don’t you
know! I’ve given you time enough on this, Winslow.
You ain’t—you ain’t square with me.
That’s what I don’t like. You’ve promised and
promised. You begged me not to send the bill
to your folks, and I didn’t. But times are hard
and we need the money. What’s more we intend
to have it.” Mr. Fallow moved ponderously toward
the door. “I’m square with folks that are
square with me, son; no one can’t say I don’t treat
’em fair; but I ain’t no one’s fool.”</p>

<p>“No, indeed, sir; anyone could see that, Mr.
Fallow.” Hugh was thinking hard. “I say,
would—would six dollars be any use to you?”</p>

<p>Mr. Fallow snorted. “It would not! Nor sixteen
dollars! Nor—nor twenty-six dollars! I
want thirty-four dollars and sixty cents. That’s
what I want and that’s what I intend to have. If
you can pay me that now, all right. If you can’t,
say so. I can’t waste any more time here.”</p>

<p>“Well, but, that’s a lot of money to get hold
of on short notice,” said Hugh ingratiatingly.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
“Suppose now I scrape up, say, twenty dollars,
eh? And then pay the rest this week.”</p>

<p>Mr. Fallow hesitated and frowned deeply. “If
you’ve got twenty why can’t you get hold of the
rest?” he asked finally.</p>

<p>“I haven’t got twenty, sir. I’ve got only six.
But I fancy I may be able to scrape up the rest if
you’ll give me a few minutes.”</p>

<p>“Well—I—all right.” Mr. Fallow reseated
himself. “But, mind you, I won’t take a cent less
than twenty. And I ain’t going to stick around
here all afternoon, either. You get a move on,
son.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be as quick as I know how, sir. You’ll
find some magazines on that table there. Just—just
make yourself comfortable, sir.”</p>

<p>Mr. Fallow grunted.</p>

<p>A minute later there was a sharp knock on
Cathcart’s door and in response to his “Come
in!” Hugh entered.</p>

<p>“Hello, Hugh,” greeted the occupant of the
window-seat. “Why aren’t you——”</p>

<p>“Don’t ask any questions, Wal! I want some
money. All you can spare, please. I’ll pay you
back before the end of the week.”</p>

<p>“Money!” Cathcart blinked. “Why, the fact
is——”</p>

<p>“I know! You’re going to tell me you’ve got<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
only a couple of dollars. That’s all right, old
chap. I’ll take it, and thank you.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got about five, I guess, Hugh. What—what’s
up?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you later. I’m in a beast of a hurry.
Dig it up, will you? Better keep out fifty cents
or so, because I might not be able to hand it back
before Friday or Saturday.”</p>

<p>Cathcart’s countenance expressed bewilderment
as he floundered to his feet and crossed to the
dresser. But he obediently handed over the contents
of a pigskin purse.</p>

<p>“Ripping!” said Hugh approvingly. “How
much? Five and a quarter? That’s eleven. I
say, keep a note of the amount, will you? Shall
I take it all?”</p>

<p>Cathcart nodded. “I shan’t need any, I guess.
Only,” he added plaintively, “I wish you’d tell
me what it’s all about!”</p>

<p>“Later,” replied Hugh, making for the door.
“Thanks awfully, old chap! So long.”</p>

<p>As he had feared, Guy Murtha was not at
home, and, after making certain that Guy had not
conveniently left any change lying around in sight,
Hugh hurried out again. Ned Stiles roomed in
Trow, and thither Hugh went. He didn’t know
Stiles very intimately, but he wasn’t going to let
that fact interfere if only he was so fortunate as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
to find Stiles in. But it was a gorgeous afternoon
and Stiles, like most everyone else, was out. Disappointed,
Hugh paused in the silent corridor and
tried to think of someone else to apply to. But
since most of his acquaintances were engaged in
some form of athletics and would consequently
be away from their rooms the problem suddenly
looked extremely difficult. Then he remembered
the office. He had never attempted to get money
there and didn’t know how his request would
be received, but he clattered down the stairs and
sought out the secretary, Mr. Pounder, a gentleman
whom he had spoken to but once and then
but briefly, the occasion being the payment of
Hugh’s fall term tuition fee. Mr. Pounder was
small, light-haired and blue-eyed, sharp-featured
and dry of voice. He received Hugh’s request
coldly.</p>

<p>“Without instructions from parent or guardian,
Ordway, we do not advance sums of money to
students, and in your case I believe that we have
not been—ah—so instructed. I am correct, am
I not?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, but I need some money very badly,
and there isn’t time to get it from home, and I
thought maybe you’d be willing to make a loan.
I could pay it back by Saturday surely.”</p>

<p>“I have no authority, Ordway. You might<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
see Dr. Duncan or Mr. Rumford. Possibly——”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe there’s time. Where could I
find Dr. Duncan?”</p>

<p>“I presume they will inform you at his house
where he is to be seen, Ordway.”</p>

<p>“Oh, piffle! All right, sir.” Hugh vanished,
leaving a surprised and somewhat shocked Mr.
Pounder in possession of the room.</p>

<p>Turning into the main corridor Hugh very
nearly collided with Mr. Crump, the janitor. Mr.
Crump was a sharp-visaged man of some fifty
years, with a leathery face, a pair of gimlet-like
eyes behind old-fashioned steel-rimmed spectacles,
and a thin, querulous voice. He was not popular
with the fellows, nor can it be said that the fellows
were popular with Mr. Crump. In Mr. Crump’s
belief the students spent their waking hours devising
ways to create dirt and dust in the
School Hall. Hugh, however, knew little of the
janitor. He had seen him about the building occasionally,
had sometimes nodded to him, and
had learned his name. Just now Mr. Crump
was a possible friend in need, and Hugh, paying
no heed to the man’s grumbles, cut off his advance.</p>

<p>“I say, Mr. Crump,” he exclaimed eagerly,
“have you any money?”</p>

<p>Mr. Crump, suspecting that he was to be made<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
the butt of some silly joke, responded shortly and
pithily.</p>

<p>“No! Get out o’ my way!”</p>

<p>“Haven’t you, honestly? I’m in a beastly fix,
Mr. Crump. I’ve got to get hold of five dollars
somewhere. I tried Mr. Pounder and he
wouldn’t loosen up a bit. I’d pay it back by
Saturday, cross my heart!”</p>

<p>Mr. Crump grasped his broom more firmly,
straightened his bent back and observed the boy
with pardonable amazement. As long as he had
been with the school, and that was many years,
no one had ever tried to borrow money from him.
Perhaps it pleased his sense of importance or perhaps
something of earnestness in Hugh’s voice
appealed to him, for after a moment’s scrutiny
he asked quite mildly:</p>

<p>“What’s your name?”</p>

<p>“Ordway.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re the English boy, be you? And
you’ve got to have five dollars, have you? Ain’t
any of your friends got that much?”</p>

<p>“I dare say, but they’re all over at the field,
and I’ve got to have the money right off, within
a few minutes. I can’t explain, but that’s the
way it is. I say, I’d be jolly glad to pay you six
for the loan of five until Saturday.”</p>

<p>“Would you now? I want to know! How do<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
I know I’d get it, eh?” Mr. Crump chuckled.
“Five dollars is a sight of money for a poor man
to risk.”</p>

<p>“But I tell you I’d pay you back!”</p>

<p>“Oh, you do, eh? I been told things before in
my life, young man.”</p>

<p>Hugh flushed and turned away. “If you think
my word isn’t good I don’t care to borrow,
thanks,” he said offendedly.</p>

<p>“Well, hold on now! I ain’t said I wouldn’t,
have I? What you so het up about?”</p>

<p>“I don’t like to have you insinuate that I don’t
keep my word, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“Tut, tut! Goodness me, but you’re a queer
one! Five dollars, you said? Four wouldn’t do
you?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got to make up twenty, Mr. Crump, and
I’ve got eleven. I’ll be glad of four, of course,
but I don’t know where I’m to get the rest. I
tell you!” Hugh pulled his gold watch from his
pocket and placed it, with the attached fob, in
Mr. Crump’s hand. “That’s worth over a hundred.
Would you very much mind letting me
have nine dollars on it? I’d redeem it Saturday
at the latest. I say, do that for me, will you?”</p>

<p>Mr. Crump looked admiringly at the watch.
“My land, but that is a nice watch, ain’t it now?
And a coat-of-arms on it, too! Worth a hundred,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
be it? I want to know! Well, I dare say
it is. Here.”</p>

<p>He handed it back and Hugh accepted it disappointedly.
“You won’t?” asked the boy. “If
I shouldn’t come for it you could easily get fifty
for it.”</p>

<p>“Could I now? Sakes alive, young man, I
ain’t no pawnbroker! My folks has lived in this
county for a hundred and seventy years. One of
my ancestors fought with General Putnam; fought
against you British he did. Here, you wait just
where you be a minute. I’ll be back.”</p>

<p>Mr. Crump leaned his broom against the wall
and shuffled away down the corridor until he came
to the basement door. After that Hugh could
hear his footsteps clap-clapping down the stairs.
Then there was silence, save for the clatter of a
typewriter in the office at the end of the hall.
Hugh looked at his watch and made a grimace of
despair. It was nearly four o’clock! He wondered
whether Mr. Crowley would put him to a
lingering death or would dispatch him quickly and
mercifully! Then Mr. Crump came back.</p>

<p>“Here you be, young man,” he said importantly.
“There’s nine dollars.” He counted them
slowly into Hugh’s hand, two twos and five ones,
all very soiled and creased. “I’m expecting you
to pay it back to me like you said, because——<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
But I know you will,” he ended hurriedly. “I
ain’t doubting your word, mind. I can see you
ain’t like the rest of these scallywags here. Maybe
it’s because you’re an Englishman and have more
sense of decency.”</p>

<p>“I say, I can’t begin to tell you how—how
grateful I am,” said Hugh. “It’s perfectly ripping
of you, Mr. Crump, and I’m no end obliged!
I’ll pay it back to you just as soon as ever I can,
by Saturday surely. Thanks awfully!”</p>

<p>“You’re welcome, sir, you’re quite welcome.
If it comes to that, I guess the losing of it wouldn’t
cripple me none. There’s—hm—I got a bit more
put away in the bank.”</p>

<p>Hugh found Mr. Fallow standing in front of
the photograph of Lockley Manor, his derby hat
clasped behind him and an unlighted cigar protruding
from under one end of that enormous
mustache.</p>

<p>“Get it?” he asked as Hugh closed the door
behind him.</p>

<p>“Yes.” Hugh pulled the money from his
pocket and laid it on the table. Then he went
into his room and returned with his own contribution
of six dollars. “There it is, Mr. Fallow.
Twenty dollars. You might count it, eh? And
I dare say you’d better give me some sort of a
receipt if you don’t mind.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span></p>

<p>“Quite a business man, you are,” chuckled Mr.
Fallow, seemingly restored to good humor by the
money. “I’ll credit the amount on the bill here.
There you are. Balance due, fourteen and sixty.
Sorry to have to seem a bit pushing, Mr. Winslow,
but in my business——”</p>

<p>“By the way, what is your business?” asked
Hugh.</p>

<p>“Eh? My business? Well, don’t you know
what you bought from me?”</p>

<p>Hugh shook his head. “I buy so much, you
see,” he replied carelessly. “Boots, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Clothes. A blue serge suit and a pair of flannel
trousers. It’s set down there on the bill.
Look here, you don’t mean that you’ve forgotten
getting them, do you?”</p>

<p>“Quite.” Hugh yawned. “One buys a good
many suits in the course of a year, you know.”
He moved toward the door. “Sorry to hurry
you, Mr. Fallow, but I’ve got an appointment.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right.” The man pocketed the
money and buttoned his coat across that gaudy
vest. “But, look here now, we don’t want any
hard feelings over this—this little matter. We’d
be sorry to lose your trade, Mr. Winslow, we
would so. You don’t need to hurry none about
that little balance. Just you take your time. And
if you want anything in our line just you let us<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
know. Always glad to serve you. I guess now,
that suit you’re wearing the trousers of didn’t
come from us, did it?”</p>

<p>“No, it happened to come from London; Ponderberry’s.”</p>

<p>“Is that so?” Mr. Fallow bent and examined
the trousers with vast interest. There was a trace
of awe in his voice as he nodded and whispered:
“Nice stuff, nice, nice!”</p>

<p>“You’ll get the rest of that this week, Mr. Fallow,”
said Hugh, opening the door invitingly.
“As I said before, I’m sorry to hurry you,
but——”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, Mr. Winslow, quite all right.
I understand.” Mr. Fallow moved ponderously
but quickly to the door. On the threshold, however,
he stopped and fumbled in a pocket. “Just
so you won’t forget us, Mr. Winslow,” he said
with a smirk. “Our card, sir. We’ve got a nice
line of woolens just arrived. Glad to have you
look ’em over any time.”</p>

<p>“Thanks awfully. Good day.” Then, with
the door half-closed, Hugh added: “Oh, I say,
Mr. Fallow!”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“I wish you’d tell me something if you don’t
mind. It’s been bothering me a bit.”</p>

<p>“Why, certainly, anything I can tell you——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span></p>

<p>“Yes; well, is that real or does it—er—come
off?”</p>

<p>“What?” inquired Mr. Fallow blankly.</p>

<p>“Why, that—that—” Hugh made a vague gesture—“that
thing on your lip.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Ha, ha, very good!” Mr. Fallow
laughed wanly. “Good—good afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Good afternoon,” said Hugh sweetly.</p>

<p>Afterwards, hurrying across the green, he said
to himself: “It was a bit caddish, and no mistake,
but after what he put me through he certainly
owed me something!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII<br />
<small>BENCHED</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Hugh remembered his reception by Mr.
Crowley for many days. Practice was
just over when he reached the scene and
the two teams were resting for a few minutes
before the scrimmage. Mr. Crowley, looking
fiercer and more disreputable than usual in the
old gray trousers and faded green sweater he
wore, was talking to Coach Bonner near the bench.
Hugh had every desire in the world to avoid
speech with him, but he disdained sneaking to the
bench and so his appearance was quickly noted.</p>

<p>“Ordway!” Mr. Crowley left the first-team
coach and walked to meet the culprit. “Let me
see you a minute.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied Hugh, very, very meekly.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you a trifle late?” asked the coach sarcastically.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I am. I’m very sorry, but something
unforeseen——”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, of course! Grandmother died,
maybe. Too bad, too bad!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span></p>

<p>“No, sir, I—someone called——”</p>

<p>“And you had to stay and serve afternoon tea?
What a bore!” Mr. Crowley’s bantering tone
ceased abruptly. “Look here, Ordway, practice
is at three-thirty. I told you when I let you come
back that you were to stick. You’re not keeping
your part of the agreement. Unless you were
detained by the faculty, in which case you should
have notified me, you have no excuse whatsoever.
I don’t want any fellows here who can’t be on
time. Life’s too short to worry about them.
Understand that?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. It won’t happen again, Mr. Crowley.”</p>

<p>“It certainly won’t!” growled the coach. He
held Hugh with a baleful gaze for a moment.
Then: “What I ought to do with you is to tell
you to clear your locker, Ordway. Got any good
reason to advance why I shouldn’t?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, sir. I didn’t intend to be late and
I won’t be late again. There was no way of
notifying you or I’d have done it. I—I’m no
end sorry, sir.”</p>

<p>“Hm; regrets aren’t reasons, Ordway. Well,
all right. But I’m hanged if I know why I’m
bothering with you anyway. I don’t need you.
What the dickens Hanrihan wished you on me
for, I don’t know! Do you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span></p>

<p>Hugh wisely remained silent.</p>

<p>“Well, I shan’t want you this afternoon. You
take the bench and watch. See if you can get
your signals straightened out. Try to forget
your social interests for a while!”</p>

<p>Hugh walked to the bench very conscious of
the amused expressions on the faces of his team-mates.
He tried to look unruffled, but he knew
that his cheeks were red, and when Brewster
Longley, tossing a ball in his hands, met Hugh’s
glance and drawled, “Hello, Royalty, old top!
Was the blighter rude to you, what? My word,
we’ll cut his bloomin’ acquaintance!” Hugh felt
angry enough to fight. But he only squirmed in
between Brunswick and Hersum and attentively
studied his hands. Then the coaches called and
the benches emptied, and Hugh, with a half-dozen
other unfortunates, snuggled miserably into his
sweater and philosophically tried to accept his
fate.</p>

<p>But it was hard luck, he thought, and while he
couldn’t conscientiously blame Mr. Crowley for
being wroth, it did seem to him that the “calling
down” was punishment enough without dooming
him to sit there on the bench and lose a whole
afternoon’s work. So absorbed was he in self-pity
and a mild resentment that he quite forgot
about Mr. Fallow and his recent activities and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
was only reminded of them when someone took
the seat beside him and a sympathetic voice inquired:
“Isn’t he going to let you play, Hugh?”
Hugh glanced up and shook his head. “Not today,
Bert.”</p>

<p>“Too bad! He’s a regular Turk, anyway.
What made you late?”</p>

<p>Hugh smiled. “Mr. Fallow.”</p>

<p>“<em>What?</em> You don’t mean——”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do, old chap. He came to the room
just as I was starting over here.”</p>

<p>“Great Scott! Did—did the money come?
But of course it didn’t! Was he mad? What
did he say? He didn’t—didn’t go to Charlie, did
he?” Bert’s anxiety was so great that Hugh,
although tempted, didn’t have the heart to prolong
his suspense.</p>

<p>“It’s all right, Bert. I paid him twenty dollars
and he’s gone home quite satisfied. In fact, he
said I—that is, you needn’t hurry with the rest
of it, and that if you want any more togs all you’ve
got to do is let him know.”</p>

<p>“But where did you ever get twenty dollars?”
gasped Bert.</p>

<p>Hugh laughed. “Borrowed it, of course. I
had six myself, Cathcart loaned me five, and Mr.
Crump nine.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Crump! <em>Mr. Crump?</em> Are you crazy?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span></p>

<p>“No, only exhausted.”</p>

<p>“But you don’t mean Mr. Crump, the janitor?”</p>

<p>“Yes I do, old chap. I fancy it was rather a
funny thing to do, but, you see, I didn’t know
who else to ask. Everyone was out and Mr.
Pounder turned me down and I happened to run
into Mr. Crump in School Hall. He was very
decent about it. I offered to let him have my
watch and fob for security but he said his grandfather
or grandmother or someone fought with
General Putnam, and wouldn’t take it. I didn’t
quite see what that had to do with it, though, do
you?”</p>

<p>“Old Crump!” marveled Bert. “I didn’t suppose
he had nine dollars to his name!”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. And he rather hinted that he had a
lot more. I dare say janiting is quite—quite
profitable.”</p>

<p>“And Cathcart loaned you five? I sort of wish
you hadn’t gone to him, Hugh.”</p>

<p>“There wasn’t much choice,” replied Hugh
drily. “I dare say if you’d been there you’d have
managed better, but——”</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean that,” said Bert quickly. “I
think you did finely, and I’m awfully much
obliged, Hugh. I only meant that—well, Wal
and I aren’t awfully good friends and—did you
tell him what it was for?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span></p>

<p>“No, there wasn’t time. I told him I’d explain
later.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t if you can help it. You see, he’s
a proctor and if he heard I’d been running bills
he might think he had to report me. He’s most
frightfully conscientious nowadays.”</p>

<p>“I hadn’t thought of that,” said Hugh, “but
I don’t believe he would. I’ll keep you out of it,
though, if you’d rather.”</p>

<p>“What did Fallow say? Was he ugly?”</p>

<p>Whereupon, while the first and second teams
battered each other up and down the field, Hugh
recounted the whole adventure for his friend’s
benefit, and Bert, alternately amused and alarmed,
listened with flattering attention. At the end he
said, after a long breath of relief: “Hugh, you’re
a corker! And a wonder! I couldn’t have got
away with it like that to save my life! And I’m
awfully much obliged, old man. I—I hope I’ll
be able to do as much for you some time.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t anything,” returned Hugh. “In
fact, it was rather good fun; or it would have
been if I hadn’t known all the time that I was
getting in wrong with Mr. Crowley. Mr. Fallow
was quite amusing. I say, Bert, <em>have</em> you seen
his mustache? It—it’s perfectly weird. I was
so fascinated by it that I just had to stand there
and stare!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t remember,” murmured Bert. Then,
after a moment: “Look here, though, if that
money doesn’t come from your folks we’ll be in
a mess, won’t we? I don’t honestly believe I’ll
be able to scrape it all up before Christmas. I’ve
got about four dollars and, of course, I’ll have
ten more the first of the month, but——”</p>

<p>“Oh, that money will come today or tomorrow,”
comforted Hugh. “Then I’ll settle up with
Mr. Crump and Wallace Cathcart.”</p>

<p>“But I’ll be owing it to you then,” said Bert
in troubled voice. “I guess it was pretty cheeky
to go to you for it, anyway, but I was so worried
about that man Fallow that I didn’t know what
to do. If he’d got to faculty I’d been fired like
a shot.”</p>

<p>“You needn’t worry about owing it to me,” said
Hugh with a shrug. “I don’t need it. Anyhow,
it’s the mater’s and she won’t mind if she never
gets it. How’s the rib?”</p>

<p>“All right, I suppose. Davy says I can’t get
back before next week, though. Last year he
fixed Musgrave’s broken collar bone up for him
so he was playing inside of ten days. I don’t see
why he needs to be so plaguy fussy about an old
rib.”</p>

<p>“My word, you didn’t expect to get back today,
did you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span></p>

<p>“No, but I thought they’d let me play Saturday
against Hollywood. I’m going with the team,
though, anyway. You coming along?”</p>

<p>“Can’t say, old chap. If Crowley doesn’t forgive
me I fancy I might as well be there as here.
If he does I dare say we’ll have practice just the
same. <em>Ouch!</em>”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, only Hanser dropped the ball then
and Nick’s got it. He’s clever at squirming
through, isn’t he? It looked as if he got right
between Longley’s legs! That gives first a ripping
chance to score,” he added anxiously. “They
must be on our twenty yards. I say, what sort of
a chap is Longley, Bert?”</p>

<p>“Brew? Why, he’s pretty good. I thought
Bonner would have him on the first this year. He
would have, too, if Willard hadn’t showed up
so well before school opened.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know he’s a good center, but is he—well,
is he a gentleman?”</p>

<p>“A gentleman?” Bert looked surprised. “Depends
on what you mean, I guess, by gentleman,
Hugh. I don’t suppose you’d call him that. I
think his father’s a contractor or something in
Springfield or somewhere.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean that. I meant is he considered
a—well, do you like him?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span></p>

<p>“Like Brew Longley? N-no, not particularly.
I don’t know him very well. I guess he’s all right,
though. Why?”</p>

<p>“Well, he seems to have it in for me, don’t you
know. He’s made a couple of—what do you call
them, now?—a couple of ‘cracks’ that I didn’t
like. I wondered whether he did it because he
didn’t know any better or because he was just
naturally a cad.”</p>

<p>“What sort of cracks?” asked Bert.</p>

<p>“Oh, he calls me ‘Royalty’ and things like that,
and talks like a silly ass on the stage, if you know
what I mean, and is really rather insolent. I
fancy he tries to make fun of the way I talk,
eh?”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s nothing to get huffy about,”
laughed Bert. “He probably thinks he’s being
humorous. You see, Duke, you’re sort of a novelty
to us. I guess Longley doesn’t know your
sort.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” returned Hugh gravely.
“But he mustn’t be too humorous or I’ll just have
to punch his head.”</p>

<p>“He’d make one mouthful of you,” laughed
Bert.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, I couldn’t help that. I’m not awfully
thin-skinned, I fancy, but I don’t like Longley’s
kind of humor. As the chap says in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
song, ‘It isn’t what he says, it’s the nasty way he
says it!’”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t mind Brew, kid; he’s harmless. I
guess he doesn’t mean to hurt your feelings.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s all right. I certainly don’t want
trouble, but I might lose my temper some day.
He can’t expect me to stick it forever. There
they go! Keyes is over! That right side of our
line is a bit sketchy. They didn’t half fool Bowen
then.”</p>

<p>“We’re giving it to you on the twenty. Say,
was Dinny awfully cross?”</p>

<p>“Rather waxy. Talked a lot of sarcasm. Advised
me to forget my social obligations or something
like that.”</p>

<p>“I’m awfully sorry, chum. It was my fault. I
wish Fallow would—would choke or——”</p>

<p>“Fall into his mustache and get lost,” suggested
Hugh. “I wonder if I’ll ever be able to raise one
like that. Sometime we’ll go over to Needham
and pretend we want a suit. I’d like you to see
that mustache, Bert.”</p>

<p>“It seems to have made a big impression on
you,” Bert laughed.</p>

<p>Hugh nodded soberly. “It did. It—it’s awe-inspiring,
colossal, epochal—er——”</p>

<p>“That’ll be about all! Half’s over. I guess
I’ll go back to the other bench. See you later,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
Hugh. Hope Dinny will let you in this half.”</p>

<p>“He won’t. He doesn’t love me a bit today.
As Mr. Smiley would say, ‘Non sum qualis
eram.’”</p>

<p>“You’re a silly ass,” laughed Bert. “Put that
into Latin!”</p>

<p>Hugh’s prophecy proved correct. Mr. Crowley
did not relent. Nor did he once appear even
to recall Hugh’s existence. And after the game
was over and first team had won by two touchdowns—no
goals were attempted—Hugh followed
the others up to the field house and changed,
denying himself, however, a shower since he had
certainly not earned it, and then proceeded rather
disconsolately back to Lothrop to find three messages
in the O-P pigeon-hole of the letter box in
the first floor corridor. Some obliging person
had written the telegrams down in his absence.
The first was from his mother in Philadelphia
explaining that an unexpected visit to friends in
the country had delayed her reception of his message
and saying that the money had been sent and
that she hoped the delay had not mattered. Another
was from the telegraph office requesting
him to call and receipt for a sum of money, and
the third, rather incoherent, was from an evidently
greatly perturbed Bowles. Hugh showed
them to Bert when the latter came in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span></p>

<p>“Mother says she has sent thirty,” said Hugh,
“instead of twenty-five, so we’ll be in funds again,
eh? Poor old Bowles is all upset. It rather
sounds as if he meant to come right up here and
rescue me from something. I fancy I’d best send
him a wire and calm him down. If Bowles ever
tried to travel anywhere by himself he’d get lost
as sure as shooting, poor old chap!”</p>

<p>Bert smiled as he read Bowles’ message. “My
lady left Thursday for New York. We have no
address. Expect back Wednesday. If anything
we can do Master Hugh please telegraph immediate.
Could leave on one hour notice. Bowles.”</p>

<p>“You’d better send him a wire, Hugh, or he
will be walking in on us. Queer idea to call your
mother ‘my lady.’ Mighty nice and respectful,
though. At home the servants always call my
mother ‘the missus’! You’ll have to beat it down
to the village tomorrow and get the tin. I’ll
go along, if you like. It’s mighty decent of her
to send that extra five. I wish my folks had
those pretty thoughts. It’s like pulling teeth to
get a dollar more than my allowance from dad!”</p>

<p>“Tell you what we’ll do with that pound,” said
Hugh, looking up from the telegram he was
formulating for the troubled Bowles. “We’ll
buy some tuck and have a feast up here tomorrow
night. What do you say?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span></p>

<p>Bert looked wistful, but shook his head. “You
forget that we’re in training, old man,” he said
regretfully.</p>

<p>“That’s so. We couldn’t, I fancy. Well, we’ll
postpone the party until after the Mount Morris
game. It’s a long old time to wait, though,
what?”</p>

<p>“Rotten,” agreed Bert. “Besides, that fiver
will be spent long before that.”</p>

<p>“No, it won’t. Or, if it is, there’ll be another.
There, that ought to settle Bowles. ‘Mother
heard from. Everything hunky here. Unpack
your bag.’ That’s only nine words, though, and
I can send ten, can’t I?”</p>

<p>“You can send fifty if you make it a night letter.”</p>

<p>“Great Scott, Bowles <em>would</em> come then! I
know; I’ll just add ‘Boosh.’”</p>

<p>“Add what?”</p>

<p>“‘Boosh.’”</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“Blessed if I know,” chuckled Hugh. “Neither
will Bowles, and it’ll give him something to study
on a bit.” Hugh added “Ordway” to his message
and laid it aside until supper time. When
one lived on the fourth floor of Lothrop one
didn’t make unnecessary trips over the stairs!</p>

<p>The next morning the two boys hurried to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
village after their French recitation and secured
the money, and later Hugh paid his debts to
Cathcart and Mr. Crump, and Bert dispatched a
money order to Fallon and Turner. Hugh managed
to appease Cathcart’s curiosity without involving
Bert’s name, although he had a suspicion
that Cathcart remained rather puzzled. Mr.
Crump seemed disappointed at being paid back
so soon and almost insisted that Hugh should
keep the money longer. But Hugh finally satisfied
him with a solemn promise to come to him
again should he ever find himself in similar financial
difficulties, and Mr. Crump, after going into
the history of his family at some length and with
much detail, tucked the bills in the pocket of his
overalls, shouldered his broom and wandered on.</p>

<p>That afternoon Mr. Crowley summoned Hugh
into the line-up as though the late unpleasantness
had never been and Hugh played through two
twelve-minute periods with so much credit that he
noticed afterwards a thoughtful and speculative
look on the countenance of Hanser.</p>

<small>BEHIND THE BOATHOUSE</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">On Thursday Coach Bonner did what the
members of the first squad had been expecting
him to do for nearly a week.
That is, he had what Nick called “his annual mid-season
spasm.” Declaring that the fellows had
apparently forgotten the very rudiments of football,
he announced no scrimmage and prescribed
an afternoon of “kindergarten stuff.” The
words are again Nick’s. The tackling dummy, of
late more or less neglected, spent the most strenuous
afternoon of its fall career. It was banged
and thumped and ground in the loam until had it
possessed a head, which it didn’t, its countenance
must have proclaimed tragic distress. Not satisfied
with a full three-quarters of an hour of tackling,
Mr. Bonner put his charges at other degrading
labors; passing, starting, crawling, pushing
the “tumbrel.” The “tumbrel” was a wooden
platform with what looked like a section of fence
erected along one side. The top rail of the
“fence” was padded and covered with canvas.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
The whole contrivance was some ten feet in length
and under it were two wooden rollers. The linesmen,
five at a time, alternately stood on the platform
to weight the “tumbrel” down and pushed
against the padded rail. The affair was officially
known as the charging machine, but its operators,
perhaps with the carts which bore victims to the
guillotine during the French Revolution in mind,
called it the “tumbrel.” Possibly it is unnecessary
to add that it was just about as popular with
them as the other vehicle was with its occupants.</p>

<p>Mr. Bonner gave an excellent imitation of a
slave driver that Thursday afternoon, even looking
the rôle as well as acting it. Simon Legree,
cracking his whip in a performance of “Uncle
Tom’s Cabin,” was a genial, mild-mannered gentleman
by comparison. After the others were dismissed
he exhibited an absolutely medieval cruelty
by keeping the punters and drop-kickers at work
until it was too dark to tell a ball from a head-guard.</p>

<p>The second team, with no scrimmage to take
part in, was dismissed a half hour earlier than
usual. Most of the members hurried from the
scene, but a few heartless ones stood about and
gloated over the sufferings of their antagonists.
One of these was Brewster Longley, and he and
Ned Musgrave, center on the first, and a natural<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
rival, almost came to blows on one occasion when
Ned took exception to one of Longley’s humorous
gibes. Davy thereupon “shooed” the idlers away
from the side-lines in a fine flow of English
strongly tinctured with Welsh brogue.</p>

<p>Perhaps Longley resented having his pleasure
cut short and perhaps his resentment was accountable
for what happened when he met Hugh and
Peet in front of the field house. Peet, although
engaged in remorseless rivalry with Hugh for a
half-back position on the second, had taken rather
a violent liking to him and was becoming somewhat
of a nuisance, although Hugh didn’t let Peet
suspect it. Peet was an upper middle fellow, a
few months younger than Hugh and extremely
uninteresting. He seldom ventured an original
remark on any subject, confining his conversational
contributions to frequent giggles which
Hugh was beginning to find irritatingly monotonous.
Today Hugh had lingered long over his
shower and dressing in the hope that Peet would
take his departure. But no such luck, for there
was the other boy awaiting him when he was
ready to go, and they passed out of the building
together and almost into the arms of Longley and
Bowen, the latter right guard on the second and
rather a crony of Longley’s.</p>

<p>Hugh murmured an apology for his share in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
the narrowly averted collision and Peet laughed
his inane giggle. Bowen nodded and pushed past,
but Brewster Longley seized Hugh’s arm and
swung him round. “Hey there, my cockney
friend!” he exclaimed. “Want the whole place
to yourself?”</p>

<p>Hugh had a peculiar aversion to being
“pawed,” as he termed it. Even if Bert, of whom
he was really fond, laid a hand on his shoulder,
Hugh was uncomfortable until it was removed.
Longley’s unexpected and unwelcome familiarity
exasperated him instantly, and it was that grasp
of his arm and not the words accompanying it
which sent the blood to his cheeks and made him
wrench himself indignantly away.</p>

<p>“Hands off, please,” he said. Tone and manner
were distinctly haughty, and Longley flared
up at once.</p>

<p>“Oh, mama! Don’t touch me, I’m ticklish!
Why, you blooming British ass, don’t you try any
of your high-and-mighty airs on me or I’ll slap
you on the wrist and break your watch!”</p>

<p>Peet giggled, and then, possibly realizing that
appreciation of Longley’s joke savored of treachery
to Hugh, passed into a fit of coughing. That
giggle was the last straw to Hugh’s exasperation.</p>

<p>“I’ve had more than enough of your sort of
humor, Longley,” he said hotly, “and I don’t propose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
to stick it any longer. You steer clear of
me after this or——”</p>

<p>“Or what?” demanded the other, thrusting his
face close to Hugh’s. “What will you do, kid?
Go on, tell me! What’ll you do? Prick me with
a hatpin?”</p>

<p>“Oh, let him alone, Brew,” interposed Bowen,
who had so far observed proceedings with amusement.
“We don’t want any international complications.”
He winked at Hugh. “Don’t want the
British navy over here blowing us up!”</p>

<p>“The British navy couldn’t blow a bubble up,”
jeered Longley. “Britishers are all bluff. Get
that, Ordway? Just bluff and—and swank! You
wouldn’t hurt a——”</p>

<p>“Take your face away from me,” interrupted
Hugh. “I don’t like it. It’s beastly unattractive.”</p>

<p>“Unattractive!” sputtered Longley. “Unat—why,
you poor cockney huckster, I’ve a good
mind to punch your silly nose!”</p>

<p>“Try it!” said Hugh quietly.</p>

<p>Longley accepted the invitation, but Bowen
jumped in and seized the back-drawn arm. “Cut
it out, Brew! You can’t fight here! Come on
along!”</p>

<p>“Can’t I?” demanded Longley, struggling to
get his arm away. “I’ll show you whether I can<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
or not! He can’t call me names and get away
with it! I’ll—I’ll——”</p>

<p>“I’m ready to fight you wherever you say,” declared
Hugh eagerly. “And if you aren’t a coward
you’ll fight, too.”</p>

<p>“Better not, Ordway,” cautioned Peet nervously,
for once forgetting to giggle. “He—he
can lick you, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll fight you, all right,” Longley was saying.
“And I’ll make you wish you’d stuck at
home with the other English dubs. Come on
down to the boathouse if you want to get what’s
coming to you!”</p>

<p>“Right-o,” responded Hugh calmly. “I say,
Peet, nip it, like a good chap, will you?”</p>

<p>“Nip what?” gasped Peet.</p>

<p>“Toddle, run along,” elaborated Hugh impatiently.</p>

<p>“N-no, sir, I’m going with you, Ordway, but
you’re a fool to fight Longley. Listen, won’t
you? He can lick you easily. Why, he’s bigger
than you and older and—and he knows how to
fight, too! Let’s—let’s beat it!”</p>

<p>But Hugh was already stalking along behind
Longley and Bowen, and Peet’s remonstrances
fell on deaf ears. Bowen appeared to be rather
half-heartedly trying to persuade Longley to turn
back, but wasn’t meeting with success. Longley’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
big shoulders shrugged impatiently and Hugh
heard him say: “Didn’t he call my face unattractive?
Well, then!” And Bowen’s reply:
“So it is, you silly chump, and what’s the good
of scrapping about it?” Peet pegged along at
Hugh’s elbow, at once excited and alarmed, hazarding
an occasional remonstrance and giggling
nervously between. Hugh wished him at the bottom
of the river!</p>

<p>The quartette passed the end of the gridiron,
on which the unfortunate first team members were
still toiling monotonously, crossed the practice
field and finally reached the boathouse. Fortunately
for their undertaking, there was no
one inside nor about the landing, and Bowen
led the way around the corner of the old building
to where a piece of fairly level sward
sloped to the river almost in the shadow of the
bridge.</p>

<p>“Now go to it, you idiots,” he said indifferently,
“if you have to. But if I sing out, beat it!
For I don’t intend to get yanked up before
Charlie, even if you do.”</p>

<p>Longley tossed his cap to the ground and impatiently
tore off coat and waistcoat, and Hugh, a
bit more calmly, similarly divested himself. Then
his opponent, scowling ferociously, advanced
across the turf, and Hugh squared to meet him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span></p>

<p>“Shake hands, gentlemen,” said Bowen facetiously,
and Peet giggled.</p>

<p>“Oh, cut out the comedy stuff,” growled Longley.
“Now then, you Little Lord Fauntleroy,
where’ll you have it?”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Some twenty minutes later, Bert, laboriously
trying to get out of his coat-sweater without hurting
the damaged rib, heard the study door open
and close quietly.</p>

<p>“That you, Hugh?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” was the quiet reply. But Hugh didn’t
appear at the doorway. Instead he crossed to
his own bedroom and Bert heard him pouring
water into the bowl.</p>

<p>“What are you so select for?” Bert sang out.
“Aren’t you speaking to your friends today?”</p>

<p>There was no audible reply from 29a, and having
got rid of the sweater at the cost of a few
twinges, Bert sauntered across the study to
Hugh’s doorway. Then:</p>

<p>“<em>For—the—love—of—Mike!</em>” whispered Bert
awedly. “Where’d you get it?”</p>

<p>Hugh, looking up from his task of applying a
wet sponge to a disfigured countenance, smiled
painfully.</p>

<p>“Longley,” he answered.</p>

<p>“Longley! Do you mean that Brew Longley<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
battered you up like that? What was the row?
Great Scott, Hugh, you’re an awful mess! What
did you do to him?”</p>

<p>“Not much, I’m afraid,” replied Hugh dejectedly.
“I got in a few, but he was too clever for
me.” He turned to the mirror over the dresser
and viewed his reflection judicially, the wet
sponge trickling water on the rug. “He’s a ripping
good fighter, Bert,” he added with what
sounded like unwilling admiration.</p>

<p>Bert, hands in pockets, gazed fascinatedly at
his room-mate’s countenance. He whistled tunelessly
and under his breath. Hugh went back to
the basin.</p>

<p>“I fancy I flattened his nose for him, anyway,”
he said more cheerfully.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Bert, emerging from his trance,
“I hope to thunder you did something to him!
For he’s certainly just about ruined you! Here,
turn around and let’s see the damage.”</p>

<p>Obediently, Hugh stopped laving his face and
Bert took stock of the contusions and lacerations.
“Your eye will be a wonder tomorrow,” he murmured
admiringly. “And you won’t be able to
talk very well for a day or two with that lip. Was
he wearing brass-knuckles, for the love of Mike?
That cut on your cheek isn’t much—when it stops
bleeding. Wait till I get some peroxide. Keyes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
has a bottle. Keep on sponging. I’ll be right
back.”</p>

<p>When he returned Hugh, in spite of directions,
had ceased using the sponge and was thoughtfully
studying two pairs of bruised and swollen
knuckles, wiggling his left thumb experimentally
the while.</p>

<p>“Well,” exclaimed Bert, “you must have got in
a few on him from the looks of those! Thumb
hurt?”</p>

<p>“Not much, I fancy. I was afraid maybe it
was sprained. I say, Bert, I can’t go to supper,
eh?”</p>

<p>Bert, sousing peroxide on a corner of a towel
and dabbing his friend’s face, considered a moment.
“Well,” he said finally, “you <em>could</em>, but I
wouldn’t advise it, Duke. Some of the faculty
are horribly suspicious.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I thought.” Hugh sighed.
“Well, I’m not awfully hungry.”</p>

<p>“I’ll fetch you something from downstairs,”
said Bert cheerfully. “And I’d better get word to
Crowley, I guess. I’ll say you’ve got a headache.
That isn’t very far wrong, is it?”</p>

<p>Hugh smiled until it hurt his swollen lip. “It’s
right as rain,” he mumbled. “You don’t need to
bring me any chow, though. It hurts to move
my mouth.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span></p>

<p>“I’m not going to bring you chow, as you call
it,” replied the other, stepping back to view the
result of his administrations. “I’ll fetch you up
a cup of cocoa and some toast. You can get that
down. There now! Got any plaster?”</p>

<p>“Yes, in the top drawer there. I’ll get it.”</p>

<p>“Hello, what have you done with your silver
brushes? And where the dickens did you get
those awful things?”</p>

<p>“Put them away a week ago. Here it is. Use
the flesh-colored. It won’t show so much. I say,
what about classes tomorrow?”</p>

<p>Bert shrugged. “You ought to have thought
of that,” he answered severely, “before you went
and did such a fool trick. Look here, what was
it all about, anyway? Didn’t you know that
Longley could beat you to a pulp? What did I
tell you the other day? Didn’t I say——”</p>

<p>“I dare say you did, old dear,” agreed Hugh
patiently. “But—<em>ouch</em>!”</p>

<p>“Well, hold still then. How do you suppose
I can——”</p>

<p>“He started on me again after practice and
got nasty and I was beastly tired of it. So—so
we went down to the boathouse.”</p>

<p>“Just you and he?”</p>

<p>“No, there was Bowen; chap who plays right
guard for us——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span></p>

<p>“I know him.”</p>

<p>“And young Peet. He’s a silly little ass. I
tried to get rid of him, but he would come. He—he
giggles.”</p>

<p>“Lie down on the bed and rest your face. Did
you fight rounds?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, we just dug in and kept it up until
Peet—er—buttered in.”</p>

<p>“<em>Butted</em> in, Duke; not buttered. What was
Peet’s trouble?”</p>

<p>“Well, you see, I was getting rather the worst
of it; sort of groggy, I fancy; my eye was bad
and I dare say I wasn’t putting up much of a fight
by that time. So Peet, the silly duffer, thought
we ought to stop and he jumped in and Longley
hit him by mistake and Peet hung on to Longley
and Bowen dragged me back and—well, that sort
of stopped the scrap, if you know what I mean.”</p>

<p>“I think you ought to be grateful to Peet,” said
Bert drily. “It was evidently time someone interfered!
I hope you managed to smash Longley
some, Duke. He had no business picking a row
with you, a fellow two years younger and half a
head smaller, and I mean to tell him so the first
time I see him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear,” sighed Hugh, “don’t you go and
get your face all beaten up, too! One of us must
keep looking decent, Bert.” He chuckled.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
“Rather a joke on me, by the way. I told Longley
I didn’t like his face, you know; said it was
unattractive; I fancy that was what got under his
skin; but he certainly got even, eh? You couldn’t
call my face attractive, could you, old chap?”</p>

<p>“Not without smiling,” said Bert. “Well, I
must beat it to supper. You take a nap if you
can. When I come back I’ll get some witch-hazel
and wrap up your hands. They’ll be as stiff as
pokers if I don’t. How do you feel?”</p>

<p>“Perfectly rotten, thanks,” replied Hugh cheerfully.
“Nip along. But, I say, I wish you’d sort
of keep quiet about it, eh? And don’t say anything
to Longley, like a good chap. I’m satisfied
and I fancy he is.”</p>

<p>“I’m not,” said Bert grimly. “Go to sleep, you
dunder-headed Englishman, and see if you can
keep out of trouble until I get back!”</p>

<p>Somewhat less than an hour later Hugh awoke
from a nap and found Bert lighting up. “Come
on out here,” called the latter. “I’ve brought
you some cocoa, and some dipped toast and a
beautiful hunk of chocolate cake. Hungry?”</p>

<p>“Rather!” mumbled Hugh, getting stiffly off
his bed and blinking his way to the study. “I say,
that looks awfully jolly. Thanks, old chap.”</p>

<p>“Well, eat it, while I go and dig up some witch-hazel.
Got some old handkerchiefs I can use?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span></p>

<p>“I’ve got some new ones that are good enough.
But don’t bother. I’ll be all right. Feeling quite
cocky already.”</p>

<p>“Well, you don’t look it!” laughed Bert.
“And, say, I got a glimpse of your friend Longley,
Hugh, and if it’s any comfort to you, he’s a
sight!”</p>

<p>“Word of honor?” asked Hugh eagerly.
“What—what’s he like?”</p>

<p>“Well, he isn’t disfigured for life, as you are,
of course, but he’s got a swollen nose that makes
him look horribly silly and he’s got the skin off
his cheek-bone. He’s no prize beauty, any way
you look at him!”</p>

<p>“But, I say, you didn’t—didn’t have any words
with him, eh?”</p>

<p>“Oh, we passed the time of day,” replied Bert
carelessly. “I’ll get that witch-hazel.”</p>

<small>“HOBO” WINS FAME</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Hugh cut chapel the next morning, but
there was French at ten and Greek at
eleven and mathematics at one, and so
it wasn’t possible to remain in retirement. Bert
consoled him with the assurance that except for
a badly discolored eye he would pass muster anywhere
as an ardent pacifist. Hugh couldn’t quite
credit that, but he had no course but to attend
classes. His appearance created interest and
aroused curiosity among his classmates, while Mr.
Teschner observed him speculatively but asked no
questions. Plenty of questions were asked, however,
and Hugh’s ingenuity was sorely taxed in
accounting for his contusions without involving
Longley. By the afternoon, though, the facts
were pretty widely known, probably due to the
communicativeness of Peet, and Hugh was no
longer required to invent.</p>

<p>He and Longley had their first face-to-face encounter
in the field house before practice. If
either experienced sensations of embarrassment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
they failed to show it. Longley nodded to Hugh
and Hugh nodded back, and that was all there
was to it except that each took surreptitious views
of the other’s countenance and, possibly, derived
a certain satisfaction from what he saw. To be
sure, Bert had slightly exaggerated the damage
to Longley, but his nose <em>was</em> noticeably enlarged
and there <em>was</em> a generous-sized place on the left
cheek where the skin was missing. Peet, perhaps
conscious of having talked too much, admired
Hugh from a discreet distance that day.</p>

<p>Although the first was due for a stiff contest
on the morrow, Mr. Bonner had no pity on them
today and they were put through a long siege of
elementary work and two fifteen-minute periods
with the second during which, with the head coach
driving them mercilessly, they managed to score
three touchdowns and would have held their opponents
safe had not Neil Ayer fortunately
dropped a goal from the first team’s eighteen
yards after a well-managed forward pass that
caught their enemies napping. After practice
Coach Crowley announced that there would be
no work for the second the next day and that
all who wished to accompany the first team to
Leeds to see the game with Hollywood would
be taken along free of charge, since the morrow’s
contest was the only one played away from home<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
that season. Needless to say, the second team
to a fellow declared their intention of profiting
by the generosity of the Athletic Association.
However, when the train left the next forenoon
the entire roster was not present. A few were
so unfortunate as to have morning recitations
which, for reasons that we will not inquire into
too closely, they dared not cut. Still, most of
them did make the trip, Hugh among them, and
were well repaid by witnessing a close and hotly
contested game.</p>

<p>Hollywood School was a pretty big institution,
with a registration of close to four hundred students,
and that the visitors held the home team
to one touchdown and scored a like number of
points spoke well for them. Oddly enough, both
the Hollywood left half-back and the Grafton
full-back failed at an easy goal and the final score
was 6 to 6, a result more satisfactory to Grafton
than to Hollywood. All things considered, Grafton
had a right to and did consider the tie a virtual
victory, while the home team and its friends
probably looked on it as closely akin to a defeat.
At all events, Grafton went home well contented
and a bit vociferous, the only fly in the ointment
represented by the fact that Mount Morris
had overwhelmingly defeated the St. James Academy
team from which Grafton had barely won<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
two weeks before. Still, as Nick declared to Bert
and Hugh on the way back to the Junction, St.
James had presented a make-shift eleven because
of injuries the Saturday previous and Mount
Morris had probably had a much easier task than
Grafton had experienced. But Nick had to acknowledge
that 26 to 3 was a heap different from
12 to 10, by which score Grafton had taken the
measure of St. James.</p>

<p>Mount Morris had been having an unusually
successful season. She had met one more team
than Grafton and had so far not only escaped
defeat but had won each contest decisively. On
the other hand, the Scarlet-and-Gray had been
once beaten and once tied; and there was a strong
probability of its being defeated again next Saturday
when it played Lawrence Textile School.
Mount Morris had a big, heavy team, although
its back-field had shown itself capable of speed,
and was playing this fall almost the same line-up
as last; a couple of new linesmen and a new quarter
were the only changes in the eleven. But today’s
showing against Hollywood was distinctly
encouraging to Graftonians, and there were
plenty of fellows among players and supporters
who refused even to consider the possibility of a
win for the green-and-white cohorts of Mount
Morris. Captain Ted Trafford was one of them,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
but Ted had the convenient faculty of being able
to believe what he wanted to, and his views had
not very much weight with his friends.</p>

<p>Bert was disappointed on Monday when Coach
Bonner and Trainer Richards refused to allow
him to go back to work. Bert declared emphatically
that his rib was perfectly all right and that
if he felt any better he’d scream, but Davy
wouldn’t sanction his return to work and without
that sanction Coach Bonner would have none of
him. Bert watched practice that day from the
bench and scowled ferociously on friend and foe
alike. Many of the first-string players were excused
and in the scrimmage the first team was
made up largely of substitutes. Derry was in
Dresser’s position at left end, Parker played left
tackle instead of Franklin, Hanrihan was in Ted
Trafford’s place, Milford substituted for Tray
at right end, and the back-field, with the exception
of Nick, who played through the first period, was
composed entirely of second-string fellows. In
the second period more changes were made, so
that when Hugh, playing right half on the scrub
team, leaped into fame in the middle of the last
period of the game, he doubtless had the wholesale
substitution to thank for his performance.</p>

<p>First and second battled through fifteen minutes
without a score, both elevens booting the ball<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
frequently in the hope that the strong wind blowing
across the field would result in a fumble.
There were fumbles, for that matter, but neither
side profited much from them, and after a five-minute
rest they went back to work with the contest
still to be won or lost. The wind was noticeably
less and first team took advantage of the fact
to try out her forward passing game. Substitutes
are somewhat like those persons who rush in
where angels fear to tread, and Gus Weston, who
had taken Nick’s place at quarter-back, had all the
rashness of his kind. One pass went nicely to
Derry and that youth managed to outwit Forbes
very neatly and reeled off twenty-seven yards and
put the pigskin on the second’s nineteen before he
was brought down by Spalding, after Hugh had
made an ineffectual effort to reach him. But
where Weston made his mistake was in trying the
same play a minute later when a line attack would
have probably secured him ground, and at all
events been far safer against a team smarting
from the degradation of that twenty-seven-yard
gain. But Weston called for the same play on
first down and the ball went back to Leddy, at
full, and Leddy heaved to a supposedly waiting
Derry. Forbes, though, was not fooled this time
and Derry had no chance of getting into position
for the catch. Someone else had, however, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
the someone else was the second team’s right half-back,
who, sensing the play from the moment the
ball was snapped, had sprinted across the field as
soon as Leddy had caught, avoided the engaged
ends and, raising an eager hand aloft in signal to
Leddy, had joyfully watched the approach of the
arching ball. Whether the full-back had been
fooled by Hugh’s signal or whether he had
trusted to Derry to get free from his antagonist
in time to make the catch is a matter of conjecture.
At all events, Leddy made an excellent
throw and Hugh made a correspondingly good
catch, and the fat was in the fire.</p>

<p>What ensued occupied so little time that to the
watchers, at least, it seemed all over almost as
soon as it had begun. Hugh had a practically
clear field for the first twenty yards and he made
the most of it. Then the pursuit moved to cut
him off from behind and the race began in earnest.</p>

<p>Hugh had captured the ball near his own fifteen
yards, for the pass had been more vertical
than forward, and he was approaching the middle
of the field, running like a rabbit, as Bert told him
afterwards, before he was really challenged.
Then it was Jack Zanetti who threw down the
gauntlet. Zanetti was a swift runner, with a commendable
Track Team record for the two-twenty,
and had he and Hugh started even the latter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
would never have had a chance of victory. But
Zanetti was well behind when the danger had
been discovered and by the time he was close to
Hugh’s flying heels he had already run a punishing
race. Behind Zanetti streamed others; Gus
Weston, Milford and Hanser possible contenders,
Leddy hopelessly out of it, and then a mingling
of friends and foes. Forbes, seeing the way
the play was turning out, had left Derry to his
own devices and was making an earnest effort to
catch up with his team-mate and act as interference,
but the handicap of distance was too great
and although Forbes did actually manage to be
in at the death he never got close enough to render
any aid.</p>

<p>Nick had told Hugh that when one was making
a long run with the ball one didn’t do much thinking.
But Hugh couldn’t agree with him, for it
seemed to him that he thought of about everything
in the world! Only, and this was a peculiar
thing to his mind, he couldn’t remember any of
his thoughts afterwards! Near the first team’s
forty-five yards Zanetti made a heroic effort to
reach the quarry. Calling on every last ounce
of strength, he sprinted and lunged forward with
groping hands. Perhaps Hugh guessed his danger,
for he swerved at the right instant and Zanetti’s
arms, although they nearly reached what<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
they sought and even threw Hugh out of his
stride, closed on empty air and he rolled over
twice and lay quite quiet until the rest of the pursuit
had labored past.</p>

<p>Milford found his second wind and gave Hugh
a very pretty tussle all the rest of the way, but the
latter crossed the goal line with dragging feet a
good three yards ahead, touched the ball to earth
and then carefully snuggled it beneath him and
ducked his head as the exhausted Milford
dropped down on him.</p>

<p>It was a spectacular performance, as all such
long runs are, but it is doubtful if Hugh deserved
all the praise he received. Granted that he had
displayed football acumen in diagnosing the play
and getting into it as he had, the subsequent task
had required little ability beyond that of running
as hard as he knew how. He had not been forced
to worm his way through a scattered defence or
dodge a hungry quarter-back on his way to the
goal. He had merely made the most of a fortunate
opportunity. Probably if he had been
playing against the full strength of the first team
he would never have been able to catch the pass,
or, having caught it, to get away with it. Much
of this he explained subsequently to Bert and Nick
and Pop and others, for he refused to view himself
as a hero, but they all scoffed and reminded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
him that he had made the longest run of the season
on Lothrop Field. Just now, having been
released from the oppressive attentions of Milford,
he was being ecstatically thumped and
beaten by his mates of the second team as, ball
under arm, he walked it out for the try at goal.
Coach Crowley even expressed mild commendation,
and in Hugh’s belief every chap on the team
took an enthusiastic whack at his tired shoulders
except Longley; and Longley grinned at him in
a most friendly and approving manner.</p>

<p>Ayer insisted that Hugh should hold the ball
for him, and Hugh was very glad that he had
watched that operation often enough and carefully
enough to be able to perform it. Ayer had
mercy on his breathlessness and gave him plenty
of time before he said “Right!” and stepped forward.
Then Hugh carefully withdrew his fingers
from under the end, heard the thud of leather on
leather and, prone on the turf—and very willing
to remain so, if the truth were known!—watched
the pigskin rise, turning lazily over end on end,
up and away and—yes, over the cross-bar!</p>

<p>Second team celebrated the advent of that
seventh point by again lavishing blows on his
back and playfully maltreating Neil Ayer. Then
they scattered to take the kick-off and Peet tugged
at Hugh’s elbow, looking very, very admiring and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
very, very apologetic, and said: “You’re off,
Ordway. I’m sorry. Give me your head-guard,
will you? Say, that was a peach of a run!”</p>

<p>Hugh yielded his guard and place, acknowledging
Peet’s compliment with a nod, and walked off
a trifle incensed with Mr. Crowley. Of course
he hadn’t done enough to have the fellows make
such a fuss, he thought, but he had scored a touchdown
and it did seem that the coach might reward
him by letting him play the time out. Mr. Crowley,
however, only waved to him in the direction
of the field house and Hugh got his sweater and
weariedly trotted off, turning deaf ears to the approving
remarks of those on the benches. If he
had done anything, he asked himself impatiently,
why didn’t they let him keep on playing?</p>

<p>But he hadn’t missed much, as he soon realized,
for he was still tugging at his sticky togs
when the released players burst in at the doors.
The second team fellows were jubilant indeed.
They had for once beaten the first in a straight
practice game! Hugh was speedily discovered
and made the recipient of further boisterous
honors, and even Longley, grinning like a catfish,
got in a slap on a bare shoulder this time and
told him he was “the pride of the noble Scrubs!”
Hugh made his escape finally and took refuge in
the shower bath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span></p>

<p>That day Hugh came into what might be
termed official possession of his nickname. One
may pass uneventfully through four years of
school life and be known as plain Jack Jones, but
once let him achieve a modicum of fame and he
is suddenly “Buster” Jones or something equally
euphonious. So it was with Hugh Oswald Brodwick.
By supper time the school was discussing,
explaining and praising the eighty-five yard run
of “Hobo” Ordway.</p>

<small>HUGH MOVES AGAIN</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Events took place so fast that week that
even Hugh’s composure was affected. On
Tuesday Coach Bonner began preparations
for the Lawrence Textile game and every
effort was made to develop the team’s offence.
To this end, following a more than ordinarily
lengthy and severe signal drill, during which three
new plays were tried out, the scrimmage with
the second was changed from two fifteen-minute
to three twelve-minute periods. The second had
to wait nearly twenty minutes for the first team,
and, since the weather had turned cold with a
vengeance, they wrapped themselves in blankets
and huddled together out of the teeth of a brisk
east wind. By the time Coach Bonner sent his
charges on the field the second team were pretty well
chilled through and let-down. The fact showed
in their playing and the first ran away with the
period and scored a touchdown and a field-goal.
In the second twelve minutes the scrubs found
themselves and put up a good defensive game,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
with the result that the first failed to get nearer
to the goal line than the thirty yards. From
there, in the last minute or two, Captain Trafford
tried a place-goal. But the wind was too much
for him and the ball went wide.</p>

<p>In the last period Hugh found himself in constant
demand. So far Brunswick and Manson,
the left half and the full-back, had done the brunt
of the work, save when an end had run behind
the line. Hugh had been used but three times in
the attack, each time taking the ball for wide end
runs and only once gaining. But now, Derry having
replaced Roy Dresser at left end, Captain
Myatt changed his tactics. Second received the
ball on a punt a few minutes after the period
started and it was Neil Ayer who began the
trouble. On the first play, faking a pass to full-back,
he plunged straight through the center of
the first team’s line for a down. Then came a
fake end-around play, Bellows leaving his place
at left end and dashing behind Ayer and, followed
by the left half, plunging around the right
wing of the line. Then, hugging the ball a moment,
Ayer shot it to Hugh, and Hugh, with full-back
interfering, went the other way. The play
was good for nearly twenty yards, for Hugh displayed
an almost uncanny elusiveness, slipping between
tacklers, dodging, twisting and always<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
going ahead. Manson was soon upset, but Hugh
feinted and fought on to the forty-eight yards
before he was finally stopped. The second
laughed and taunted as they lined up again. Manson
shot into left tackle but was stopped for a
yard. Ayer tried a quarter-back run and made
three. Then Hugh heard the signals again summon
him. This time it was a straight run around
his own left end. Derry was pulled out and
Franklin was neatly boxed and only the first
team’s secondary defence kept Hugh from again
getting safely away. As it was he added
six yards and made first down once more. Brunswick
fumbled on the next play and Manson recovered
for a five-yard loss. Hugh failed on a
wide run around his own left end, being thrown
by Ted Trafford, and Ayer kicked from position.</p>

<p>The first came back hard then and tested the
second’s defence pretty severely. Siedhof gave
place to Hanser on the first and Boynton took
Brunswick’s place on the second. The second
also put in a new left tackle and a new left guard.
First was using straight line-plunges and getting
away with them. On the second’s fifteen yards
Vail, right half on the first, was hurt in a tackle
and Zanetti went in. Twice the second held the
besiegers under the shadow of their goal and then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
Ted Trafford tried another goal from placement
and barely made it.</p>

<p>Second kicked off and Nick ran back to the
forty-five yards, through most of the second team.
Then two line plays were stopped for small gains
and Keyes threw forward to Tray near the second’s
thirty-five and the right end made a clever
running catch and added another five yards of
territory before Myatt downed him. With time
almost up and the ball on the second’s thirty, Nick
again called for a forward, but this time the ball
grounded. A skin-tackle around Spalding netted
four yards and Keyes plunged through Longley
for two more. Keyes then went back to drop-kick
and when the ball shot to him the first team’s
left side crumbled badly and Bowen hurled himself
through and blocked. The ball trickled up
the field to the twenty yards before Zanetti fell
on it. Two wide sweeps by Keyes around the left
end gained but four and once more he tried for a
field goal. But the angle was extreme and the
ball went astray.</p>

<p>Longley kicked off to Zanetti, who caught on
his fifteen, fumbled, recovered and was thrown
by Forbes and promptly sat on by Hugh. The
first got to the twenty yards on two plunges and
Keyes punted. Hugh, playing back with Ayer,
caught near his forty and ran across the field,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
avoiding the first team’s left end, and Ayer and
Forbes formed into interference and disposed of
two of the enemy. Hugh was still running
toward the other side line, zig-zagging miraculously
between his foes. Thrice he was almost
caught and thrice he managed to escape. Then
his interference went to pieces and he was speeding
down the field some five yards from the side
line with not one chance in ten of getting away.
A first team tackle dived and missed, Hanser
loomed in his path and Hugh went around him
like a frightened rabbit and suddenly only Nick
was left to contend against, Nick running fast a
few yards behind and gaining a little at every
stride.</p>

<p>Near the twenty-five yards Hugh shot a quick
glance behind him and then, with an unexpected
increase of speed, cut across in front of Nick just
out of reach and headed straight for the goal.
Zanetti and others were trailing along some ten
yards back and this change of direction brought
them nearer their prey, and Zanetti took courage
and sprinted. But it was Nick who was destined
to save the day for the first. Try as he might,
Hugh couldn’t shake him off, and just short of
the twelve yards it was all over. Nick’s arms
slipped around Hugh’s knees and all the latter
could do was hug the ball very tightly and go<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
down. And as he did so he heard Nick’s voice.</p>

<p>“Sorry,” panted Nick, “but—I—gotter—do
it!”</p>

<p>Although second lined up quickly and shot
Manson at the center, it was not destined that
they were to score. Manson got a scant yard,
whistle and horn sounded together, and the game
was done.</p>

<p>“We’d have gone over in two more plays,”
panted Neil Ayer as he walked off beside Hugh.
“I don’t believe time was up. They were afraid
we’d score on them! That was a pretty run of
yours, Hobo. I thought you were gone a dozen
times. You sure can dodge like a rabbit.
Where’d you learn it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Hugh. “Right here, I
fancy.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t you ever played before?”</p>

<p>Hugh shook his head and Neil viewed him
appraisingly. “You’re built for it, I suppose. If
you had another twenty pounds on you you’d be
a wonder.”</p>

<p>The school seemed much inclined to consider
him a wonder as he was, and his fame grew
mightily. Hugh made the discovery that evening
that his circle of acquaintances was much wider
than he had supposed. Fellows who had previously
never noticed his existence spoke to him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
almost eagerly and seemed quite pleased if Hugh,
disguising his surprise, murmured a response.
Juniors gazed upon him with bated breath, only
daring to nod, but upper-class fellows called him
“Hobo” to his face and grinned in friendly manner.
Of course he liked it; no fellow could fail
to; but it made him feel, as he confided to Bert,
“a bit of an ass, if you know what I mean.”</p>

<p>He went to bed that Tuesday night a star half-back
on the second team. He awoke on Wednesday
morning a substitute on the first, but he didn’t
know it because he hadn’t overheard part of a
conversation which had taken place the evening
before in the front room of a little white house
in the village. The front room, used by Coach
Bonner as a sitting-room, held two persons beside
the head coach. These were Assistant Athletic
Director Crowley and Trainer Richards. It was
no uncommon thing for them to meet there after
supper and go over the day’s work together,
and now that the season was nearing its end
these conferences took place almost every night.
The portion of the conversation which would
have interested Hugh had he heard it was
this:</p>

<p>“That lays Vail off for most of the week,
then,” mused Mr. Bonner. Davy Richards
nodded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span></p>

<p>“When do you want Winslow to come back?”
asked the coach.</p>

<p>“He might play Saturday if you need him.
I’ve got a pad fixed up for him.”</p>

<p>“Can he get into practice by Thursday?”</p>

<p>“Sure, if he don’t get into it too hard.”</p>

<p>“He will have to play Saturday, that’s certain.
Half the game, anyway. That leaves me short
in the back-field. That fellow Hanser doesn’t
work very well, Dan.”</p>

<p>“He’s as good as I’ve got, Coach.”</p>

<p>“He may be now, but he won’t be if Ordway
keeps coming. That kid’s a wonder in a broken
field. If you built up a game around him, Dan,
you’d have a mighty good attack for the middle
of the field.”</p>

<p>“He’s clever,” acknowledged Mr. Crowley,
“but he’s light. Next year——”</p>

<p>“Tell you what, Dan, you take Hanser and let
me have Ordway. Look here. Mount Morris
has a heavy, slow line and her ends aren’t remarkable
when you come right down to brass tacks.
They haven’t shown anything against any team
they’ve met yet. Did you read the Mount Morris—St.
James game? Well, Mount Morris’ ends
were never under the punts. St. James ran the
ball back five to fifteen yards every time. With
ends like those, why couldn’t this Ordway fellow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
get away? Wait a bit. Suppose we worked up a
shift formation that brought their tackle over to
the long side of their line. Then suppose we send
a fake attack on that side, pull Trafford out and
send him and Ordway around the short end?
Why wouldn’t that make a good get-away play
around the twenty-five-yard line? I believe we
could work up a play that could score for us.
That rascal is a marvel at squeezing through the
tight places. All he needs is a lot of work to give
him experience.”</p>

<p>“Too light in weight,” growled Mr. Crowley.
“They’d stop him quick.”</p>

<p>“Sure, they would if they caught him. But he’s
something like an eel, as I figure it. No, you take
Hanser and give me Ordway, Dan, and I’ll make
a regular back of that kid. Or I will if he doesn’t
get hurt. That’s one trouble; he’s likely to bust
something, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Not him, Coach,” said Davy. “He’s the supple
kind.” (Davy pronounced it “soople,”
though.) “There ain’t a stiff bone in his body,
sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, you can have him, of course,” said Mr.
Crowley. “Maybe you’re right, too. He is
clever, and he—he’s neat; handles the ball nice,
travels nice; sort of clean-cut in his style.”</p>

<p>“Good! Send him to me tomorrow, Dan.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span></p>

<p>And that is why Hugh, or, as he was popularly
known now, Hobo Ordway, again transferred his
ketchup bottle and marmalade jar, this time back
to Lothrop and the first-team training table, and
also why he came to find himself at four-fifteen
on Wednesday afternoon sitting beside Bert on
the first-team bench, very much surprised and a
little bit frightened at what was before him!</p>

<p class="cap">Bert got back to light practice the next
afternoon but not into the game with the
scrubs. Siedhof and Zanetti were the
halves that day, with Hugh substituting for
Zanetti toward the end of the last period. If the
truth must be told, Hugh did not cover himself
with glory, for he fumbled once at a critical moment
and lost his team a chance to score and
never made a gain worth recording. But it was
perhaps more due to stage fright than anything
else, and Coach Bonner realized the fact and
dealt out no criticism. Oddly enough, it was the
released Hanser who performed the only spectacular
feat of a slow and listless game when he
squirmed through the left of the first team’s line,
threw off Siedhof’s tackle and romped straight
down the field for twenty-five or -six yards before
Nick stopped him. That incident spelled the end
of Kinley as regular left guard. Yetter succeeded
him before the next play and held the position
the balance of the season. Kinley had been a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
troublesome problem all the fall and with his retirement
the left side of the line stiffened considerably.
Mr. Crowley had his joke with Coach
Bonner on the performances of the exchanged
half-backs, but the latter only smiled and said
“Wait.”</p>

<p>There was only signal work on Friday for the
first-team members and most of the school attended
the final class game over on the practice
gridiron and saw lower middle triumph over upper
middle by the score of 7 to 0.</p>

<p>Lawrence Textile School presented a strong
team the next afternoon and started the proceedings
by dropping a kick over Grafton’s goal six
minutes after play began. Grafton put on her
strongest line-up, Vail, whose injury had proved
more stubborn than expected, being the only regular
member absent. Bert showed the results of
his idleness and was off his game. Hugh did not
get in.</p>

<p>Grafton’s only score came in the second period
when two forward passes took the ball from her
forty yards to Textile’s eighteen and Zanetti
gained around the left end and Keyes gathered
enough to make it first down by a plunge on the
Textile right guard. From the seven-yard line
the ball went over in three plays, one a delayed
pass to full-back, who got three yards through<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
center, another a skin-tackle play by Bert that
put the pigskin on the two yards, and the third a
straight plunge by Keyes with the whole team behind
him. Keyes kicked an easy goal.</p>

<p>But that was the only time Grafton was dangerous.
In the last half it was all Textile, and
the visitors secured a touchdown in each period
and kicked a goal each time. The final score was
17 to 7.</p>

<p>The game proved one thing long suspected,
which was that the Scarlet-and-Gray line was far
from a perfect machine on defence. Time and
again Textile opened holes wide enough to drive
a wagon through. The power was there and the
knowledge, but the fellows didn’t work together.
It was the secondary defence alone that kept the
opponent’s score down to anything like what it
was. On the left, Yetter, while showing up superior
to Kinley, was constantly fooled on plays
inside his position. He worked at odds with his
center and was, besides, slow at getting into plays.
On his left, Franklin was another weak defender,
although a brilliant tackle on offence. Pop Driver
was steady and dependable, a trifle slow, perhaps,
but a hard man to fool. He and Musgrave, at
center, and Ted Trafford at his other shoulder,
made that side of the line fairly impregnable, although
Ted, like the other tackle, was a better<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
offensive than defensive player. The ends had
showed up satisfactorily, with the honors, if any,
belonging to Roy Dresser. As to the back-field, it
was hard to judge, since it was a patched-up affair,
with Bert playing only a part of the game and
Vail not getting in at all. Neither Siedhof nor
Zanetti were better than average backs. Nick, at
quarter, had played as he always did, hard and
cleverly, handling punts in the back-field faultlessly,
running back well and choosing his plays wisely.
Keyes had gained as consistently as usual with the
ball, had been a tower of strength on defence and
had punted excellently. Leddy had proved himself
a good substitute for Keyes. On the whole,
there was no fault to be found with the material.
Grafton possessed eleven good players and was
well off for second-string men. The team simply
hadn’t developed as it should have.</p>

<p>The Lawrence Textile School game was played
just a fortnight before the date of the Mount
Morris contest, and there were those a-plenty
who declared that two weeks was all too short a
time in which to bring the Grafton team to championship
form. What Coach Bonner thought, no
one knew, but on Monday it was evident that the
first team was in for strenuous work and that if
it was humanly possible to lick it into shape Mr.
Bonner meant to do it. The second team was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
given the ball at the start of the scrimmage and
told to put it over by line-plays. When she lost
it, as she frequently did, it was promptly handed
back to her. Both coaches were on the field and
the playing was often stopped while they corrected
and explained, scolded or commended. The second,
driven to a sort of berserker rage, hammered
every position in the opposing line desperately,
Mr. Crowley barking and growling and urging
them on.</p>

<p>Hugh got into it in the second ten-minute period
and played through that and most of the third,
until a blow on the head turned him so dizzy that
Davy Richards, hovering about the scene like an
anxious mother hen, called him out. He did good
work on the defence, too, considering his lack of
weight. He seemed gifted with the faculty of
anticipating the play and getting into it almost
before it reached the line, although it was really
less a gift than it appeared. What Hugh did was
to watch the ball, instead of the players, and more
than once Nick’s shouted warning proved wrong
and Hugh’s diagnosis correct. He was pretty
roughly used, for the second was in no mood to
deal gently with objects in its way, and frequently
he fumed in secret at his lack of weight.</p>

<p>In the final period—the second had so far failed
to cross the defender’s line—the second was given<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
the ball four times in succession on the first team’s
ten yards and urged to take it over. But it was
not until they had been allowed an extra down,
with the ball on the two yards, that Manson piled
through between Musgrave and Yetter and scored
the single tally. It was in that mix-up that Hugh
got his knock-out and Vail went in to finish the
game.</p>

<p>Monday’s practice was a fair example of every
day’s proceedings until Thursday. On Thursday
the lower middle team, champions of the school,
trotted over and faced the first. They proved an
easy prey, and the first had little difficulty in running
up twenty-seven points while the lower middlers
were earning a scant six by the air route.
Coach Bonner tried out two new plays which the
first had been learning, and was able to gain with
each several times. The best for all-round purposes
was a split play in which an end shifted to
the other side of the line and played some two
yards back. The backs arranged themselves in
oblique tandem, the ball went to full-back, quarter
and the back-field end swung around one wing,
the two half-backs around the other and the full-back
plunged straight ahead, usually finding his
passage clear. It was rather a difficult play for
the opponent to diagnose, for it had all the earmarks
of a forward-pass to either side of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
field. The lower middlers never did solve it,
although that by no means guaranteed that it
would succeed more than once against Mount
Morris.</p>

<p>The other new play, although he didn’t know
it, was designed to make use of Hugh’s running
ability. It was a tackle-over shift, with the back-field
in square formation and the ball going to
right half—in this case Hugh—on a direct pass.
The attack was faked at the long side, and right
half, with left interfering, went around the short
side, the runner turning in sharply when the way
was clear. The same formation was used for a
variation in which left half ran wide beyond the
short side and took a forward pass from full-back.
The variation proved less certain of success,
however, and was abandoned after a few
subsequent try-outs against the second. But the
play in which Hugh figured was tried four times
in that Thursday game and gained each time.
Once Hugh got clean away and covered half the
field before he met his Nemesis in the shape of
the opposing quarter, who, in spite of Hugh’s
attempt to elude him, stopped further progress
with a neat and decisive tackle. Another time
Hugh gained twelve yards before he was brought
down from behind, again he almost got clear and
reeled off the better part of twenty, and, on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
last attempt, with the ball under the shadow of
the enemy’s goal near the eighteen yards, he
dodged his way through at least a half-dozen opponents
and scored the first’s fourth touchdown.</p>

<p>All that sounds as though Hugh played most
of the game himself, but it is needless to say that
he didn’t or that his part was only a small part
after all. He held his own well on defence and
several times made short gains on the wings, but
lack of weight told against him. One thing he
did not do, however, was fumble. Unfortunately
the same cannot be said of either Bert or Vail.
Bert played three periods at left half and Vail
one period at right, going out in favor of Hugh.
Vail’s fumble was not costly, but Bert’s was, for
he dropped the ball when tackled in the line and
a lower middler fell on it and three minutes
later the pigskin was floating over the cross-bar
for lower middle’s first field goal. The whole
truth is that Bert played poorly that day. His
sins were not only of commission, like that fumble
on the twenty-yard line, but of omission, as when,
time after time, he was stopped short in his tracks
before he had penetrated the enemy’s first line of
defense. Siedhof, who replaced him, while not
especially effective, at least gained occasionally
through a not very strong line.</p>

<p>Bert was ill-tempered and depressed that evening,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
and when Hugh, feeling very happy over his
showing, tried to cheer him up, Bert sneered at
him. “You think you know a whole lot, don’t
you?” he asked. “Think you’re a regular fellow
now, I guess. You’ve got a whole lot to learn
yet about playing half, let me tell you. When
George Vail gets back you’ll last about ten seconds
and then you’ll find yourself ‘chewing the
blanket’ again.”</p>

<p>“I dare say,” responded Hugh good-naturedly.
“Don’t know just why Mr. Bonner has been so
decent to me, anyway. Of course, I know I can’t
play like you and Vail, old chap. Never thought
so for a minute.”</p>

<p>“You act so,” growled Bert. “Coming around
and patting my head! I’ll be playing half when
you’re shouting ‘Rah! Rah!’ on the stand.”</p>

<p>“Right-o! Sorry I spoke.”</p>

<p>“You kids,” continued Bert, “have a lucky day
and make a couple of runs and then think you’re
the whole shooting match! You make me tired!”</p>

<p>Hugh made no reply, and presently went off
down the corridor to visit Cathcart, who was
nowadays voicing regret that the other had gone
over, apparently body and soul, to what Cathcart
called “the muscle-worshippers.” But Cathcart
was entertaining three professed “grinds,” and the
conversation soon bored Hugh and he left. On<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
the way over to Trow he wondered whether football
was as Cathcart predicted, really lessening
his interest in what that same youth would probably
have termed, “more vital matters.” Certainly,
a month ago the conversation he had
listened to almost in silence would have engrossed
him far more. He confided his doubts to Pop,
whom he found quite alone for once, and Pop
replied that he thought it didn’t much matter.</p>

<p>“Of course, a fellow gets his mind pretty well
filled with football about this time of year. It’s
natural, Duke. But I don’t see that it does him
any harm. After the Mount Morris game he
comes back to earth, sometimes with a bit of a
thump, and has time to think of other things.
Cathcart’s an awful high-brow, anyway. He will
have brain fever some day or go to the funny-house.
If I did all the worrying over the whichness
of the what that he does I’d be food for
the squirrels. Forget it.”</p>

<p>Being in an unusually confidential frame of
mind this evening, Hugh told of Bert’s ill-temper,
and Pop smiled. “You really mean,” he asked,
“that you don’t know what’s troubling Bert?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t, really. Should I?”</p>

<p>“Well, you would if you stopped to think a
minute. Look here. George Vail’s not fit to play
much yet, and won’t be, I guess, before next Saturday.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
Siedhof and Jack Zanetti aren’t first-team
caliber yet, although Billy may be by next year.
That leaves Bonner in a hole, doesn’t it? He
knows that he’s got to make up his backs from
Bert and George and, if you keep on coming,
you. Well, Vail isn’t in shape yet, and Bert isn’t
doing much either, and there you are.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but—where am I?”</p>

<p>“Why, Bonner is looking to start the Mount
Morris game with two of you three fellows, don’t
you savvy? Now the question is, which two?
Bert and George? Bert and you? George and
you? He can’t tell yet, and you can see that he’s
doing a lot of thinking. Well, Bert sees that and
he’s thinking too. Just at present you and he are
about an even choice. Vail will probably come
around all right and be sure of his position, but
you and Bert will have to fight it out for the other
place. That’s the way it looks to me, Duke. And
that, I guess, is what’s worrying Bert. When the
season began he was the only possibility for left
half. Then he got up in the air about something,
played like the dickens, got a busted rib because
he was thinking of something else instead of playing
the game, went off on his work—natural
enough after a week or ten days’ lay-off—and now
doesn’t seem able to come back. It’s got on his
nerves, I suppose. And he’s taking it out on you.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
He has a punk temper, anyway. And then, too,
you’ve suddenly sprung up as a rival. And Bert
resents it. Hasn’t any right to, but I guess he
does, because I know Bert pretty well.”</p>

<p>“I wish I’d never gone in for football,” sighed
Hugh after a moment’s silence. “I never thought
for a minute, you know, that—that anything like
this would come up. What’s to be done?”</p>

<p>“Done? Nothing’s to be done. Don’t be a
chump. Bert will get over his grouch tomorrow
and then you and he will fight it out, just as lots
of other fellows have, and the best man will win.
Or, anyway, the one who promises to be the more
useful a week from Saturday will win. It’s up to
Bonner, you know.”</p>

<p>“But I thought that Bert was absolutely certain,”
faltered Hugh.</p>

<p>Pop shrugged his big shoulders. “So he was
until a while back. He started off finely. There
isn’t a better half-back on a prep school team
today than Bert Winslow when he’s playing right.
But he hasn’t been playing right for nearly a
month. Well, three weeks, anyway. What a fellow
has done doesn’t count much. It’s what he’s
doing and can do. Frankly, Duke, if you keep
on getting a little better every day, as you’ve been
doing, you’ll play against Mount Morris as sure
as I’m a foot high; perhaps not all through, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
half the game, anyway. You take my advice and
quit worrying about things. Just put everything
out of your mind but playing half and try like the
dickens!”</p>

<p>“I don’t know that I want to do that, though, if
I’m crowding Bert out and——”</p>

<p>“Piffle! If you don’t crowd him out Jack
Zanetti will, or Billy Siedhof, unless he gets a
move on and fights for his place. Nick and I were
talking about it last night and Nick wanted me
to give Bert a hint. But what’s the use? He
knows it as well as I do. He’d only tell me to
mind my own business. Quite right, too. So I’m
going to.”</p>

<p>“Then you think I ought to keep on?”</p>

<p>“Of course. What else? We’re here to lick
Mount Morris, aren’t we? If you can help, it’s
up to you to do it. Be as sorry for Bert as you
like, but don’t let it interfere with your game,
Hugh. It’s up to him.”</p>

<p>The entrance of Roy Dresser put an end to the
topic, and presently Hugh went back to Lothrop.
Bert was not there, for which Hugh was glad.
He got ready for bed, found a magazine to read
and crawled in. But the magazine lay face-down
on the spread, for the talk with Pop Driver had
provided him with material for much perplexed
meditation.</p>

</div>


<p class="cap">The next morning Bert had apparently
forgotten his grievance, although he
looked as if he had spent an unrestful
night and was fidgety and troubled. Hugh saw
little of him until practice time. That afternoon
there was only light work for the players and the
scrimmage with the second team was short, if
lively. Bert and Zanetti started the game and
later Bert went out in favor of Hugh, and Zanetti
gave way to Vail. The latter seemed as good as
ever today and went to work with a will. Hugh,
during the time he was in the game, had few
opportunities for offensive work but made one
good rush of some ten yards when he was let loose
outside left tackle. Siedhof played a few minutes
in Hugh’s place at the end of the scrimmage.</p>

<p>The first showed the effect of the week’s work
and undoubtedly displayed a better defence than
theretofore. During the fifteen minutes of actual
playing time it scored twice on the second and held
its opponent safe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span></p>

<p>Football enthusiasm had been rampant for over
a week and already two mass-meetings had been
held. The third came off that Friday evening
and everyone piled into the assembly hall and
cheered and sang and whooped things up generally.
The Mandolin and Banjo Club occupied
the stage and supplied music for the songs. Hugh
secretly thought the enthusiasm a bit “made-to-order”
as he expressed it. But Hugh had not yet
accustomed himself to the idea of organized
cheering, which he still considered a trifle ridiculous.
But he liked the singing and got into the
songs with a will. Captain Trafford predicted
victory for the Scarlet-and-Gray; Coach Bonner
warned them against overconfidence, and Mr.
Smiley quoted much Latin and made them laugh
frequently. As a demonstration of loyalty and
faith in the team the meeting was a great big
success, but it didn’t affect the result of next week’s
game the least particle, and so, in Hugh’s mind,
was rather a waste of energy. Even Wallace
Cathcart attended, and Hugh, to his surprise,
caught him with his mouth very wide open and
his face very red, cheering like mad. The first
and second team players sat together in front and
Hugh found himself beside Tom Hanrihan. Hanrihan
had displayed a kindly interest in Hugh’s
career from the first, and tonight, in a lull between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
a cheer for Coach Bonner and a song, he said
confidentially:</p>

<p>“You’re doing fine, Hobo. Just you keep it
up, son, and you’ll have your letter. If you do
you’ll be one of the youngest fellows to get it.
Bonner can’t keep you out of that game if he wants
to, by gum! I sized you up right the first day
I saw you; remember? Yes, sir, I liked your style
right then, and I told Bonner so, too. I sort of
discovered you, Hobo, and if you don’t play a
regular star game next week I’ll beat you up!”</p>

<p>Then the mandolins and guitars and banjos
struck up “Here We Go!” and Hanrihan and
Hugh, the latter referring to the printed slip in
his hand, joined in the rollicking refrain:</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Grafton! Grafton! Here we go,</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">Arm in arm with banners flying!</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Pity, pity any foe</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">When it hears us loudly crying:</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">‘Grafton! Grafton! Rah, rah, rah!’</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">All together! Now the chorus:</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">‘Grafton! Grafton! Rah, rah, rah!’</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">Victory today is for us!”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Finally, “Nine long ‘Graftons,’ fellows, and put
some pep into it!” and then the exodus, with much
scraping of settees and laughing and whistling.
And afterwards, for Nick and Guy Murtha and
Harry Keyes and Hugh, a Welsh rarebit in Nick’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
room, made over an alcohol lamp and extremely
hot with cayenne pepper!</p>

<p>Southlake Academy was the visitor the next
afternoon. Southlake had played Mount Morris
earlier in the season and had been soundly drubbed
by the score of 19 to 0. But Grafton did not
hope to make so good a showing. Nor did she.
Southlake was a better team that day than she had
been when the Green-and-White had vanquished
her, and she soon proved the fact. Coach Bonner
started with two substitutes in the line, Hanrihan
for Captain Trafford and Willard for Musgrave
at center. But Musgrave was hurried in
before the game was five minutes old and, although
Captain Ted stayed out of the conflict until the
third period began, he, too, had to be sent to the
relief. The back-field was Blake, Winslow, Vail
and Keyes during the first half. Then Weston
took Nick’s place, Siedhof went in for Vail, and
Leddy played full. Hugh was half sorry and
half glad that he was being kept out. He wanted
to play hard enough, but he feared that if he did
go in it would be in place of Bert, and their relations
were strained enough as it was. Bert had
hardly spoken a word, civil or otherwise, to his
roommate since yesterday’s practice!</p>

<p>There was no scoring on either side until the
second period was ten minutes along. Then a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
lucky fluke gave Grafton the ball on Southlake’s
twenty-two yards and she took it over in seven
smashing attacks on the center. Keyes missed
goal. After that Southlake sprang some open
plays which, if they didn’t gain very much ground,
considerably worried and exasperated the enemy,
who, for a while, didn’t know how to meet them.
Still, the nearest Southlake came to a score was
getting down to Grafton’s seventeen yards, where
she was held for downs, and Keyes kicked out of
danger.</p>

<p>Hugh watched the work of the half-backs attentively.
Vail was covering himself with glory
and Bert was doing considerably better on attack
than he had been doing of late, but was frightfully
weak on defence. Time after time he was
outside the play entirely, while, when he did get
into it, he was quite as likely to miss his tackle
as make it. Even Hugh, who was desperately
anxious to make the best of Bert’s performance,
could not fail to see that he was trying the patience
of his team-mates and, probably, of Mr. Bonner
as well.</p>

<p>Southlake tried two forward passes in the
third period and again got within scoring distance.
She faked a drop-kick and sent a back on a wide
run around Roy Dresser’s end and Roy, for once,
was neatly boxed. Bert was the man to stop the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
runner and Bert made a miserable failure of the
attempt, getting his man and then losing him
again. Just how Yetter got into the affair was a
mystery, but it was the left guard who pulled the
Southlake runner down just short of the goal line.</p>

<p>Franklin had been showing distress for some
time and now Parker was sent in to play left
tackle. At the same time Keyes was put back
again, and it was perhaps the big full-back’s presence
which stopped the enemy’s advance. Two
tries lost her a yard and then she tried a drop-kick
and it was Keyes who leaped into the path of
the ball and beat it down. Southlake recovered
on the fifteen, but she fumbled a minute or two
later and the pigskin was Grafton’s.</p>

<p>It was then that the Scarlet-and-Gray showed
real form. From her own fifteen-yard line to the
middle of the field she went in five plays, Keyes
and Roy Dresser bringing off a forward pass that
covered more than half the distance, and Vail and
Siedhof, and once Keyes, plunging through the line
for the balance. A second attempt at a forward
pass grounded, but Vail got away outside the
Southlake right tackle and reeled off fifteen yards,
and from there down to the sixteen Grafton
plugged relentlessly. There was a mistake in signals
then and some four yards was lost, and Weston
elected to try a goal from the field and Captain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
Trafford went back. But the line weakened somewhere
and Ted had no chance to kick and Weston,
holding the ball for him near the thirty-yard line,
could only snuggle it beneath him and yell,
“Down!”</p>

<p>It was then that Coach Bonner beckoned Hugh
from the bench. “Go ahead,” he said, “and see
what you can do. Tell Weston to use Number
17, Ordway.”</p>

<p>Hugh pulled off his sweater and legged it across
with upraised hand, and the stand cheered him.
Bert saw him coming and began to tug at his head
harness. Then he stopped and waited.</p>

<p><a href="#i_fp288">“You’re off,” said Hugh. “May I have that,
please?”</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" id="i_fp288">
  <img src="images/i_fp288.jpg" alt="" title="" />
  <div class="caption"><p class="noic"><a href="#Page_289">“‘You’re off,’ said Hugh. ‘May I have that, please?’”</a></p></div>
</div>

<p>Bert handed over the leather guard silently, but
his expression wasn’t pleasant and Hugh heartily
wished that the coach had chosen Zanetti instead
of him. But there was no time for regrets then.
He whispered his instructions to the quarter-back,
repeated them in reply to Captain Ted’s anxious
question, pulled the head guard on and sprang
into place.</p>

<p>It was third down and about fifteen to go.
Weston called the signals, Trafford crossed to the
other side of Parker, and Keyes stepped farther
back and held his hands out, the halves crouched
wide apart, and Weston, stooping behind Musgrave,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
repeated the signals. Then the ball came
back, straight and fast, and Hugh snuggled it
in the crook of his arm, started quickly, and, running
low and hard, swept past his line on the heels
of Siedhof, while Weston and Keyes sped toward
the other end. For a moment, a critical length
of time just then, Southlake lost sight of the ball.
When she had solved the play Siedhof had spun a
Southlake tackle from the path, and Hugh had
responded to the frantic cry of “<em>In! In!</em>” and was
through. Siedhof met the charge of a half, but
went down in the encounter, and Hugh, twisting
aside, circled out, passed the twenty-yard line,
dodged another back and, with the hue and cry
close behind, raced over the remaining four trampled
white marks and was only stopped when a
despairing quarter, wrapping tenacious arms about
his legs, brought him to earth well back of the
goal line!</p>

<p>Grafton shouted herself hoarse, only letting up
for a minute while Keyes directed the ball and
subsequently booted it deftly over the bar. After
that Grafton played on the defensive for the rest
of that period and the next, and, although there
were some anxious moments, kept what she had
earned. While 13 to 0 didn’t sound as well as
19 to 0, it perhaps stood for quite as much if
we consider the fact that Southlake was a stronger<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span>
team today than when she had met Mount Morris.</p>

<p>Being a hero is a trying business, as Hugh soon
discovered. Naturally somewhat retiring, he disliked
the sudden publicity that enveloped him, and,
being modest, he felt uncomfortable under the
praise bestowed on him. Fellows took, he thought,
a ridiculous amount of pains to go out of their
way to shake his hand or even slap him familiarly
on the shoulder and tell him what a wonder he
was. He knew very well that he wasn’t a wonder
and he didn’t like being called one. He belonged,
in part at least, to a people who abhor being
conspicuous and who view askance anything savoring
of hysteria, and, in spite of his American
experiences, he had not lost those feelings. No,
on the whole the succeeding week was not a very
comfortable one for Hugh. He hoped that after
a day or two the school would cease its “bally
nonsense,” but he was reckoning without the fact
that it was wrought up to a fine state of tension
and that the tension increased every hour as the
Mount Morris game approached. Consequently
the “bally nonsense” continued and Hobo Ordway
was never allowed to get out of the lime-light for
a minute.</p>

<p>But what troubled Hugh far more than fame
and its consequences was Bert’s attitude. After
the Southlake game no one, and surely not Bert,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
doubted for an instant that Hugh had won his
position. Another fellow might have swallowed
the lump in his throat and smiled, or, being resentful,
might have hidden the fact. But not so
Bert. He made no secret to Hugh or anyone else
that he thought he had been badly treated. Or
perhaps, which is more likely, he pretended to
think so. At all events, life in Number 29 was
difficult and increasingly unpleasant. Bert seldom
spoke unless addressed by Hugh and then answered
coldly and sneeringly. By the middle of
the next week Hugh kept away from the study
as much as he could and gave up trying to bridge
the chasm. On one occasion, driven out of his
usual patience by a surly response, he got thoroughly
angry and wanted to fight on the spot.
Bert, though, refused to afford him that much
satisfaction, telling him sarcastically that if he
(Hugh) got hurt and couldn’t play they’d surely
lose the game!</p>

<p>Nick and Pop each told Bert that he was making
an utter ass of himself, but beyond such satisfaction
as they got from airing their opinion,
nothing came of it.</p>

<p>There was light work on Monday for the regulars,
although those who had not participated
strenuously in Saturday’s contest were given the
usual medicine. On Tuesday there was a hard<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span>
practice, and, in the evening, an hour’s signal drill
in the gymnasium. The program was the same the
next day. That afternoon, Bert, if he still entertained
hopes, must have seen the futility of them.
For he spent the whole period of scrimmaging on
the bench and saw Hugh occupying the place he
had looked on as his. Although no official statement
to the effect was made by the coaches, it was
generally understood that the line-up that day
was the one which would face Mount Morris on
Saturday. Of course Bert would get into the game
for a while beyond the shadow of a doubt, but
that brought no satisfaction to him. What increased
his sense of injury was the fact that the
day before, playing two of the four ten-minute
periods against the scrubs, he had held his own
with any of them. And he knew now that if he
could only get in on Saturday he could play the
game of his life!</p>

<p>Perhaps it was a final realization of his defeat
that changed his attitude toward Hugh that evening.
When both boys were back in the study after
the signal work in the gymnasium Bert volunteered
a remark in a very casual but surprisingly inoffensive
voice. Hugh answered in kind, and,
rather embarrassedly, they fell into a discussion
of the plays they had rehearsed, of the team’s
chances, and of kindred subjects. Then, when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>
Hugh had gone to bed and his light was out,
Bert’s voice reached him from his doorway.</p>

<p>“Say, Hugh!”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>An instant’s silence, and then: “I’m sorry I’ve
been such a rotter.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right, Bert!”</p>

<p>“Yes, but——” Another silence, and finally:
“It isn’t all right at all! I—oh, well, what’s the
use? I’m sorry. I guess that’s the whole yarn.
It isn’t your fault, you know, and I—I hope you
do fine, old man! Just rip ’em right up the back!”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” replied Hugh in the darkness, “but
I wish it were going to be you, Bert, honest! I
don’t want to play a mite. I’m beastly sorry I—I——”</p>

<p>“Oh, rot!”</p>

<p>“But I am, though! I feel an awful ass, if you
know what I mean; butting in like this and doing
you out of your place on the team when I can’t
begin to play the way you do, old chap! It—it’s
piffling poppycock! That’s what it is! Piffling
poppycock!”</p>

<p>He appeared to derive a lot of satisfaction
from the phrase, and Bert heard him mutter it
over again to himself as he felt his way into the
room and sat on the foot of Hugh’s bed.</p>

<p>“No,” he said, tucking his feet up out of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span>
draft from the open window, “no, that’s not true.
You play just as good a game as I ever did, Hugh.
You can’t get around that. And what’s a heap
more, you’re steady. I never was. I’d play good
enough one day and then be perfectly rotten the
next, maybe. What gets me, though, is how the
dickens you ever learned in only about eight
weeks!”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know. And, anyhow, that’s got
nothing to do with it. I never imagined that
I’d get in your way, Bert. If I had I’d never
have gone in for the silly game. Now look what’s
happened!”</p>

<p>“Well, what has happened? I’m out and you’re
in because you deserve to be. Besides, there’s
another year coming, isn’t there? Football doesn’t
stop after Saturday, you know.”</p>

<p>“That’s taking it mighty well,” said Hugh
warmly. “But—just the same I don’t like it. It
makes me feel an awful rotter, an out-and-out
rotter, old chap! If there was any way to—to—to
back out——”</p>

<p>“Don’t be a chump! There isn’t, and if there
was you’d have no right——”</p>

<p>“Why not? I know there isn’t, of course, but
I don’t see why I shouldn’t have the say about
playing. Of course I can’t go to Mr. Bonner and
say ‘Look here, you know, I’ve changed my silly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
mind and don’t think I’ll play Saturday.’ That
wouldn’t do, of course. But, just the same, it’s
tommyrot to say I haven’t the right, you know.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t,” declared Bert decidedly. “The
team needs you and it’s up to you to do your level
best.”</p>

<p>“My level best is no better than yours, though;
not so good, in fact. How do you know that I
won’t have stage-fright Saturday and drop the
ball or—or try to swallow it? You can’t make
me believe that if something happened so I
couldn’t play you wouldn’t do just as well and
probably better than I would!”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what I’d do,” answered Bert
thoughtfully. “Yes, I do, though, old man. I’ve
got a perfectly magnificent hunch that I’d play
good ball if I got a chance. But that’s got nothing
to do with it. I shan’t have the chance unless
Bonner puts me in for a little while at the end.
He probably will, you know; after we’ve got the
thing cinched or we’re so far behind that nothing
matters!”</p>

<p>“Well, there it is, then!” said Hugh triumphantly.
“You <em>know</em> what you can do and I don’t!
What I say is——”</p>

<p>Bert laughed. “Oh, you dry up and go to
sleep, Hugh. It’s all right, old man. I did act
like a beast, and I’m sorry, and I beg your pardon.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>
And that’s all of that, I guess. For the rest of
it, I hope you’ll play a rattling good game, Hugh,
and if I’m to substitute you I hope I won’t get in
at all. Good night!”</p>

<p>“Well, but—now hold on, old dear! I want to
tell you——”</p>

<p>“Not tonight. It’s after eleven. Go to sleep.”</p>

<p>Hugh grunted as he heard the bed creak in the
other room. Then he thumped his pillow and
settled down again.</p>

<p>“Just the same,” he murmured, “it’s piffling
poppycock! That’s just what it is, piffling poppycock!”</p>

<small>HUGH GOES TO THE VILLAGE</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">There was the lightest sort of practice
on Thursday for the regular, but the
third-string players, reinforced by three
or four first subs, among them Bert, gave the second
a hard tussle for two fifteen-minute halves.
Hugh didn’t see that game, for with the other
first-choice players he was dispatched to the showers
the minute practice was done, but he heard
about it afterwards from Peet, who, at least according
to his own story, was the one particular
bright spot in the second team’s back-field. Peet
wasn’t a very eloquent conversationalist and his
report was vague and jerky, but Hugh gathered
that Bert had more than distinguished himself that
afternoon. There had, said Peet, been one burst
through the whole second team that had netted
forty-odd yards. And he had frequently piled
through Myatt and Bowen for three and four at
a whack. You just couldn’t stop him! He’d
gained two once with both Hanser and Ayer
hanging around his neck! And, in the end, he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span>
had crashed his way through the second team’s
center from the six yards for the only touchdown
scored by the substitutes. Hugh was very glad
and hoped that Coach Bonner, who, according
to Peet, had watched the game through, would
change his mind and let Bert start on Saturday.</p>

<p>That was the second team’s final game of the
season and they won it 10 to 6. When it was over
they cheered the first team, the coaches, the school,
themselves and whatever else they could think of,
and joyfully—and perhaps a little regretfully—disbanded.</p>

<p>Bert was in good spirits that evening. He had
had a fine time in the game and told Hugh all
about it while they sat on the steps of Lothrop
after supper and waited until it was time to go
over to the mass meeting. But when Hugh suggested
that perhaps, because of the good showing
he had made, Mr. Bonner might put him into the
line-up instead of one Hobo Ordway, Bert
shrugged.</p>

<p>“He won’t. I know Bonner pretty well. Anyway,
I don’t care so much now. I had a bully
time knocking around this afternoon and I’ll get
a whack at Mount Morris if only for five minutes
or so, I guess, and that’ll do. What time is it?
We’ve got to sit on the stage tonight like a lot
of wax figures. That’s what I always feel like<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>
when I’m on exhibition. Joe Leslie’s going to talk
tonight. Have you heard him? Oh, yes, he jawed
at Lit one time you were there, didn’t he? Well,
he’s a dandy at it and no mistake. Joe always
calls the turn, too. Last year he said we’d lose
and we did. Year before he said neither team
would score more than once, and, by Jove, he was
right then, too. We played a nothing-to-nothing
tie! Joe knows football from A to Izzard, and
he would have been a peach of a player if he
could have gone in for it.”</p>

<p>“What was the trouble?”</p>

<p>“Folks didn’t want him to. He—what?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say anything.”</p>

<p>“Thought you did. Well, let’s go over.”</p>

<p>Sitting on the stage to be admired was a little
uncomfortable, Hugh thought, even though he and
Bert secured chairs in the third row and were not
much in evidence from the floor. As on previous
occasions of the kind, the Mandolin and Banjo
Club did its best—and sometimes it sounded like
its worst!—speeches were made, cheers were given
and songs were sung. To the delight of everyone,
the prophetic Joe Leslie, senior class president,
predicted a Grafton victory, although he
warned his hearers that the team would have to
work for it and that its margin of points would
be scanty. Joe could talk to the fellows in what<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span>
Vail, who sat at Hugh’s other side, called “words
of one syllabub,” and he was always a big success
as a speaker. Tonight he had his audience with
him from the first moment and before he was
through had worked them up to such a stage of
enthusiasm that they threatened to lift the roof
off the building.</p>

<p>When the meeting was over the football players
disappeared quickly, for tonight and tomorrow
night they were supposed to be in bed by ten
o’clock, and, lest they be disturbed, all noise in
rooms or corridors after that hour was taboo.
Hugh, who had been noticeably distrait all the
evening save when Joe Leslie’s eloquence had absorbed
him, piled promptly into bed, beating the
clock by ten minutes. Bert was disposed toward
conversation, but found scant encouragement from
his chum, and at ten all lights were out in Number
29. Bert was just falling into a delicious state
of drowsiness when a sound from the opposite
bedroom brought him back to consciousness and
he sat up suddenly. It seemed to him that Hugh
had said “That’s it!” very loudly. However, as
all was silent, he concluded that he had dreamed
it, and so sank back again and went to sleep.</p>

<p>The next forenoon, clad in a yellow slicker,
since it was drizzling, Hugh inconspicuously let
himself out the service door on the basement floor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>
of Lothrop, climbed two fences, cut across a corner
of a meadow, and finally, a bit wet as to
lower extremities, reached the village road and
trudged off into the mist. He was back a half-hour
later, in time for French, and, so far as he
knew, his absence was passed unnoticed.</p>

<p>It drizzled all day, and toward evening grew
colder. The gridiron, covered with a sprinkling
of marsh hay, remained deserted. At four o’clock
the team met in the gymnasium and had a half-hour’s
drill on signals, and then again, at half-past
eight, there was a blackboard talk. But the
day went slowly to most of the fellows and the
weather affected tight-strung nerves, and everyone
from Coach Bonner down to the least important
third-string substitute was heartily glad when bedtime
came. The school held an impromptu celebration—if
you can call it a celebration when the
thing to be celebrated hasn’t occurred—on the
campus and did a good deal of singing and cheering
and shouting while it marched around the
buildings. But the drizzle soon discouraged it
and long before ten o’clock Grafton School was
as quiet as the proverbial mouse. Hugh had a
good deal of trouble getting to sleep that night.
He could hear Bert’s hearty and regular snores
from the opposite room and envied him. Probably,
he reflected, Bert had a clear conscience,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span>
while his own—well, he didn’t quite know whether
it was clear or not. He only knew that he had
done something that morning which might or
might not prove to have been for the best. Sometimes,
he concluded, as he thumped his pillow into
a new shape, life was most beastly complicated.</p>

<p>When he awoke after a none too refreshing
night it was still dull and foggy outside, although
the drizzle had ceased. There was a light glaze
of ice over everything and the limbs of the trees
outside the windows crackled when a slight puff of
wind blew the gray mist across the campus. It
was a dispiriting scene, Hugh thought, but Bert,
who came yawning in a moment later, appeared
to find it quite to his liking.</p>

<p>“Ugh! Put that window down! Say, this is a
bully day for the game, isn’t it? Just snappy
enough!”</p>

<p>“The field will be wet, though, won’t it?” asked
Hugh.</p>

<p>“Not to mention. The sun will be out before
noon, and that hay will keep it pretty dry, anyway.
Had your bath—pardon me, tub?”</p>

<p>“No. You go ahead if you like.”</p>

<p>“All right, your ’Ighness, I’ll do that very
thing. Say, what’s wrong with you? Got the pip
or anything? You look like a last summer’s
straw!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span></p>

<p>“Me? Oh, I’m all right, I fancy, thanks. I—didn’t
sleep very well.”</p>

<p>Bert chuckled and playfully shied a pillow at
him. “Nerves, me dear boy, nerves! You’ll feel
better after you’ve got some food—that is, chow,
inside you. I’ll yell if there’s a tub not working.”</p>

<p>Bert’s prediction was verified. Hugh did feel
better after his breakfast. Possibly the discovery
that he was not the only fellow at the training
table that morning who resembled a last summer’s
straw helped as much as the food. As has been
said before, Hugh had a horror of being “different.”</p>

<p>There was no school that day. Experience had
proved to the faculty that holding recitations on
the morning of the Big Game was about as useless
a thing as could be imagined. Many fellows
headed for the village shortly after breakfast,
but the players were not allowed that means of
working off any superabundance of spirits. Instead,
being instructed to remain out of doors as
much as possible, they dawdled around from one
set of steps to another and tried to be very jovial
and carefree. The sun came through about ten
and the trees glittered as though strung with diamonds.
Then the diamonds turned into very wet
water and dripped down fellows’ necks.</p>

<p>Bert and Hugh and Nick and several others<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[305]</span>
were seated on the steps of Trow at about ten-thirty.
Talk had been desultory and fragmentary
for some time, and Nick, the only one of the group
apparently unaffected by nerves, had just informed
the rest candidly but for their own good that they
were a “bunch of nuts,” when Mr. Bonner came
into view down the steps of School Hall, looked
this way and that and then walked briskly along
to Trow. He had the appearance of one who,
having completed a home-run, is informed by the
umpire that he is out for not having touched second.
Every fellow in the group there knew that
something had greatly disturbed the coach’s equanimity,
and when, pausing a dozen yards away,
he called to Hugh, his tone confirmed the look on
his face.</p>

<p>“Ordway, please!” he called. “Just a moment!”</p>

<p>Hugh arose and wormed his way between the
others. Probably they all glanced curiously at
him as he passed down the steps, but I doubt if
any save Bert read the expression on his face
aright. To Bert it was one of relief.</p>

<p>Hugh joined Coach Bonner and together they
walked toward School Hall and disappeared
through the entrance. Speculation was rife in
front of Trow. Nick shook his head dubiously.</p>

<p>“Something’s gone to pot,” he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span></p>

<p>“Faculty’s jumped on Hobo, probably,” suggested
another. “Thought, though, he was rather
a shark for study.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t that,” said Nick. “What do you think,
Bert?”</p>

<p>But Bert only shook his head. If it was what
he really thought, it wasn’t a thing for him to
talk about.</p>

<p>Five minutes later Hugh came out of School
Hall and walked toward them again. Seeing his
face, Nick breathed easier. If it was anything
bad the Duke wouldn’t smile like that. When he
reached the steps Hugh stopped. By that time the
smile didn’t look so good to Nick. There was
something not quite regular about it!</p>

<p>“Anything wrong?” asked Yetter.</p>

<p>“Rather, in a way,” answered Hugh. Bert
noticed that his friend avoided looking at him as
he made the announcement. “My folks—that is,
my mother doesn’t want me to play. She telegraphed
the faculty. Bonner—Bonner’s a bit—peevish.”</p>

<p>The silence was broken by the dry tones of
Nick.</p>

<p>“Strange he should be,” he murmured.</p>

<p>Hugh nodded, smiled, and turned away in the
direction of Lothrop. A chorus of regrets, of
protests, of questions went after him, but he kept<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span>
on. Bert watched him disappear into the building
before he jumped up and hurried after.</p>

<p>“What,” demanded Bert, as he closed the door
behind him, “what is this—this”—unconsciously
he adopted Hugh’s phrase of the other evening—“this
piffling poppycock?”</p>

<p>Hugh, standing at the window, one knee
on the cushion, turned and smiled conciliatingly.
“Mother telegraphed to faculty. She doesn’t want
me to play. She—she’s afraid I’d get hurt, don’t
you know. Of course, it’s bally nonsense, but
there you are, what?”</p>

<p>Bert advanced into the room and shied his cap
to the table. Then he plunged his hands in his
pockets and observed sweetly:</p>

<p>“Must have been an awful surprise to you!”</p>

<p>Hugh colored. “Well, there it is, eh?”</p>

<p>“Most breaks your heart, doesn’t it?” continued
Bert with suspicious sympathy.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, now, old chap, of course a fellow’s
disappointed, and all that, but——”</p>

<p>Then Bert let loose. I’m not going to try to
say what he did, partly because it was all dreadfully
incoherent and partly because he used expressions
and called names that barely escaped
being in shocking bad taste. One of the nicest
things he called Hugh was a “dunder-headed ass”!
And Hugh took it all quite good-naturedly and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>[308]</span>
very calmly, even seating himself as though in
order to listen more attentively. And when, at
last, Bert petered out for lack of breath or language,
Hugh only grinned at him!</p>

<p>“You can’t prove anything you’ve said,” he
remarked finally, just when Bert showed a disposition
to go on again. “And, anyway——”</p>

<p>“I don’t have to prove it; I <em>know</em> it!” bellowed
the other. “I’m not a complete fool!” He glared
at Hugh a space longer and then subsided in the
Morris chair. “What—what did you do it for,
Hugh?” he asked almost pathetically.</p>

<p>Hugh blustered weakly. “I haven’t said I’d
done anything, have I? That’s your story. If
you don’t believe me when I tell you that—that——”</p>

<p>“Well, go on,” said Bert sarcastically.</p>

<p>But Hugh didn’t. “Anyway, it’s done and
that’s all there is to it. What’s the good of cutting
up rough?”</p>

<p>“Hugh, you’re an ass.”</p>

<p>Hugh smiled and shrugged his shoulders. “I
say, you know, you’ve told me that before a number
of times.”</p>

<p>“And I tell it to you again, you—you chump!
If this ever gets out Bonner will scalp you and
the school will chase you from here to the Junction!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309"></a>[309]</span></p>

<p>“Why should it get out, as you say? And—and
what is there to get out, anyway?”</p>

<p>“There’s this. You wrote home and got your
mother to send that telegram, and if that isn’t——”</p>

<p>“I didn’t!” denied Hugh.</p>

<p>“You didn’t! Look here, can you look me in
the eyes and say you didn’t put your mother up
to it?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t write home,” replied Hugh evasively.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s it! You telegraphed! Of course
you did! And that’s what you were thinking of
when you said ‘Oh!’ or something when we were
talking about Joe Leslie. That put the silly stunt
into your head, didn’t it?”</p>

<p>“I say, what’s the good of getting all excited
about it?” said Hugh soothingly. “It’s quite all
right, old dear. All you’ve got to do, you know,
is calm down and go in this afternoon and give
’em ballywhack!”</p>

<p>Bert was silent for a moment. Then: “What
did Bonner say?” he demanded.</p>

<p>Hugh smiled ruefully. “He was crusty a bit,
if you know what I mean.”</p>

<p>“I think I do,” said Bert grimly. “Does he—suspect
anything?”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear, no! Why should he?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[310]</span></p>

<p>“Well, he might. Hang it, Hugh, I’ve got a
half a mind not to play!”</p>

<p>Hugh laughed. “Change it, old dear! Bonner’s
fit to be tied now. If you tried anything
like that on he’d just simply blow up—<em>Bing!</em>
Just like that! Don’t be a silly ass, please.”</p>

<p>“But, Hugh, I wish you hadn’t! I feel so
mean, don’t you see? And suppose Bonner doesn’t
put me in, after all! Suppose he plays Siedhof
or Zanetti! Suppose, even if he does put me in,
I don’t play decently, or——”</p>

<p>“Suppose you’re a piffling idiot, and shut up!
Bonner’s got to put you in. And you’ve got to
play the way you did Thursday and you’re going
to! Now come on out and get some air.”</p>

<p>Bert didn’t stir at once, though. Instead, he
studied his knuckles a long moment, leaning forward
in his chair. Then, rather huskily: “Hugh,
you’re a mighty good sort,” he faltered. “And
I’ve been such a rotter that I don’t see why you
want to—to——”</p>

<p>“Piffling poppycock!” said Hugh.</p>

<small>BOWLES ATTENDS A FOOTBALL GAME</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">At a little before three that afternoon a
carriage, drawn by a weary-looking gray
horse, turned into the campus from River
Street and finally stopped in front of School Hall.
The single occupant alighted, paid the driver and
ascended the steps with a suggestion of dignified
haste. Some three minutes later, by which
time the carriage which had brought him
from the Junction was out of sight around a
corner, the passenger reappeared and crossed
the campus in the direction of a large open plot
of ground from which loud and at times quite
appalling sounds broke upon the afternoon
air.</p>

<p>He was a neatly attired man of about thirty-five,
clean-shaven, and of a serious cast of countenance.
He was quite evidently English, and
self-respecting to a degree. That was apparent
in his carriage, his expression, and his attire. He
crossed the green, entered the gate of Lothrop
Field, and paused inquiringly in front of a youth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>[312]</span>
with a scarlet ribbon on his coat who guarded
the entrance to the stands.</p>

<p>“Fifty cents, please,” said the youth.</p>

<p>The latecomer put a well-gloved hand in a
pocket, drew forth a pigskin purse and selected
the required amount. Then he passed around a
corner of a grandstand and found himself confronted
on one side by sloping tiers of seats
crowded with onlookers and on the other by an
expanse of yellowing turf over which a number
of persons were hurrying about in an apparently
purposeless way. A second ribbon-badged youth
arose from the steps of the stand and said:</p>

<p>“You’ll find a seat further along, sir; about
three sections down.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir, but I am looking for—for
Mr. Ordway.”</p>

<p>“Ordway?” The youth shrugged. “I can’t
tell you where he’s sitting. He was to have
played, but something happened. I’m afraid you
can’t stand here, sir. You’re obstructing the view
of people in the lower seats.”</p>

<p>Already requests to “Move on, please!” were
being made, and the man, still searching the crowd
as he went, proceeded in the direction indicated.
But finding anyone in that throng was like looking
for a needle in a haystack, and he began to
realize the futility of his task. Half-way along<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a>[313]</span>
he stopped very suddenly and clutched at his very
respectable derby hat. Someone had almost
knocked it from his head with a waving flag,
while a most barbaric and disconcerting shouting
caused him to gaze about, startled. He could,
however, see nothing to account for such an outburst,
and, prompted by cries of “Down front!”
and “Keep moving, please!” he went on and was
finally taken pity on by a third ribbon-adorned
usher and conducted up a number of steps and
placed precariously on the last eight inches of a
narrow seat.</p>

<p>He looked about him carefully. There seemed
to be hundreds of persons there, old, middle-aged
and young, and many were waving flags of vivid
scarlet bearing white G’s, and all, or so it seemed
to him, were shouting. Beside him was a boy of
possibly sixteen years, a rather nice-appearing
youth, but one who continually jumped half out of
his seat or prodded the man’s ribs with a sharp
elbow. The newcomer made a careful and systematic
survey of as much of the audience as was
within his range of vision, but without finding Mr.
Ordway, after which he philosophically settled
down, if such a thing is possible when your neighbors’
knees and elbows are continually being poked
into you, and did his best to understand what was
going on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314"></a>[314]</span></p>

<p>Before him, on a white-barred field, two groups
of young gentlemen were facing each other. Those
of one group were bright red as to arms and legs
and those of the other dark green. Besides the
number engaged in the contest—the man placed
that number as between twenty and thirty; possibly
because several of them kept moving about
all the time—there were two older persons on
hand, one of whom was an extremely active gentleman,
judging from the manner in which he ran
back and forth. While he looked someone blew
a whistle and the two groups of players suddenly
became inextricably confused. Some ran one way
and some another and each seemed mainly bent
on getting into the next fellow’s way! And then,
quite from nowhere, a green-stockinged youth
shot into prominence and ran very fast across the
field in the observer’s direction. He had a football
in one arm and held the other stiffly before
him. The reason for this was presently made
plain when a scarlet-legged youth tried to interfere
with him. That extended hand came into
contact with the scarlet-legged youth’s face and
the latter swerved quickly aside. But the lad
with the green stockings didn’t get much farther,
for two other scarlet-legged players literally
hurled themselves on him and he was sent headlong
across the white line and into a windrow of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"></a>[315]</span>
hay. The man, rather startled by such violence,
understood at once that the hay had been placed
there for humanitarian purposes.</p>

<p>Everyone shouted things then, while, to the surprise
of the man, the assaulted youth arose nonchalantly,
shook himself, and trotted further into
the field, where, presently, the whole performance
was gone through with again. The man was perplexed.
Football he had heard of but never witnessed,
and it was very difficult to understand.
On a board at one end of the inclosure was the
legend:</p>

<p class="noic">GRAFTON</p>

<p class="noic">VISITORS</p>

<p>That, of course, meant that neither side had as
yet succeeded in making a tally. The man wondered
what they did to make a tally, and while
he was still wondering a gentleman wearing a
white sweater ran frantically onto the field and
tooted an automobile horn. Whereupon, with one
accord, the players of both sides drew apart and
then trotted diagonally down the field and disappeared
from sight.</p>

<p>The man started to get up, saw that only a very
few were following his example, hesitated, and
resumed his seat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316"></a>[316]</span></p>

<p>“I beg pardon, sir,” he said to his neighbor,
“is there more of it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, that’s only the first half,” replied the
boy, a note of surprise in his voice. “You got
here late, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. The train I reached Needham Junction
on did not connect with any train for this
place and I was obliged to take a fly—er, carriage,
that is to say. It took some time.”</p>

<p>“I guess it did!” The boy observed his neighbor
interestedly, a bit puzzled. “Too bad to miss
a whole quarter after coming so far, sir.”</p>

<p>“I beg pardon, but I’m not—that is, you——”
But he gave it up. He wanted to tell the boy
that he preferred not to be called “sir,” but he
couldn’t think of a way to do it.</p>

<p>“Come from New York?” the boy was asking,
frankly curious.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, but from Baltimore before that. I
left there last night. I came to see Mr. Ordway;
Mr. Hugh Ordway. You might know him, sir?”</p>

<p>“Know Hobo! Well, I guess! Everyone
knows Hobo Ordway!”</p>

<p>“No, sir, Hugh, if you please, sir.”</p>

<p>“I know; that’s him. The fellows call him
Hobo on account of his initials; H. O. B. O. don’t
you see? Friend of yours, sir?”</p>

<p>“My master, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"></a>[317]</span></p>

<p>“Your—I didn’t get that!”</p>

<p>“I’m Master Hugh’s man, sir. We were a bit
worried about him and my lady sent me up to see
if everything was all right.”</p>

<p>“Oh, then you’re the valet chap he brought
along with him when he got here?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; Bowles, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, what do you know about that?”</p>

<p>“You mean, sir——”</p>

<p>“Why, say, Mr. Bowles—or ought I to call you
just Bowles?”</p>

<p>“Just Bowles, if you’ll be so kind, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, Bowles, you don’t need to worry
your bean about Hobo. He’s as right as a trivet,
or tight as a rivet or whatever you say. Only
thing that’s bothering him, I guess, is that his
folks butted in at the last moment and told him
he couldn’t play. But I guess you know all about
that?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, sir. You see he telegraphed——”
Bowles stopped and coughed discreetly. “That
is to say, we telegraphed——”</p>

<p>“Fine piece of business, I don’t think, Bowles!
What’s the big idea? Think he’d get killed?”</p>

<p>“Can’t say, sir. It was her Ladyship’s idea.
It’s an extremely rough game, this football.”</p>

<p>“Rough! Sure, it’s rough, but—who’s her
ladyship?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318"></a>[318]</span></p>

<p>Bowles again coughed behind his hand. “Mrs.
Ordway, sir, Master Hugh’s mother. We—we
always call her that. It’s a habit, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, say, if you want to find Hobo you’d
better beat it right now. He’s on this side somewhere,
I suppose. Say, Jennings, seen Hobo Ordway
lately?”</p>

<p>“Sure! He was on the bench with the subs
during the first half,” responded the next boy.</p>

<p>“Then you go down there where you see those
benches and he will be back again pretty soon.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir, but possibly I’d better wait
now until the football is over. That is to say,
if you’re quite certain he is all right.”</p>

<p>“Was this morning, anyway. I talked to him
coming out of dining hall. There they come!
<em>Grafton! Grafton!</em>”</p>

<p>There had been a good deal of singing and
cheering during the absence of the teams, but now
the uproar became positively deafening. Everyone
stood up and shouted long and loudly and, if
they had pennants, waved them. Bowles stood
up too, but he didn’t shout, although he almost
wanted to! Then a quick, sharp cheer broke forth
from one side of the field, and a long, growly cheer
floated back from the other, and the players came
into sight again around the corner and went to
their benches. And Bowles, watching eagerly,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319"></a>[319]</span>
saw Master Hugh! But what a disreputable looking
Master Hugh! Bowles almost dropped in his
tracks! No wonder, indeed, that they called him
“Hobo”! A pair of old gray summer trousers,
a faded blue sweater, a diminutive cloth cap on
the back of his head, and a pair of kicked-out tan
shoes on his feet! Bowles groaned and was, oh,
so thankful that her Ladyship was not there to
witness the disturbing sight! And then others cut
off his view and somewhere a whistle blew and
the cheering began again and—</p>

<p>“Come on, Grafton! Let’s score now!” yelled
a voice in Bowles’ ear, and an elbow dug sharply
into his side and someone behind him sent his
respectable derby over onto the bridge of his
respectable nose. Bowles rescued his hat and gave
his attention to the field. The ball was floating
lazily aloft in the sunlight and under it the players
were running together. Then it came down, a
boy got under it and clasped it to his stomach,
dodged this way, feinted that, was caught, escaped,
ran a few yards and was pulled down. Bowles
thought he could almost hear the thud of that
body!</p>

<p>“Extremely rough,” he murmured, “oh, very.”</p>

<p>But after that he gazed, at first interested and
then fascinated, and soon forgot whether football
was rough or otherwise! His neighbor, supplying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320"></a>[320]</span>
the unsought-for information that his name
was Stiles, threw light on the endeavors of the conflicting
groups briefly, succinctly, and Bowles
began to fathom the philosophy of the game.
Minutes passed. The play surged this way and
that, the ball, however, straying never very far
from the center of the gridiron. The teams were
evenly matched, it seemed. Toward the end of the
third period Mount Morris tried a difficult field-goal
from the enemy’s thirty-eight yards, but the
ball fell far short of the goal and came speeding
back in the arms of Nick Blake. They seemed now
to be doing more kicking, for the pigskin was frequently
in air. Once Vail, playing back with Nick,
fumbled a punt and a groan of horror arose from
around Bowles, but the next instant Vail had shouldered
a Mount Morris end aside and himself
fallen on the bouncing ball.</p>

<p>Beside Bowles, his neighbor sat on the edge of
the seat and squirmed and yelped and shouted:
“Get him, Ted! Get him, you chump!... Here
we go, fellows! Oh, look at that! Forty-five
yards if an inch! Keyes can’t punt a bit, can he?
He’s no good at all, is he? Forty-five yards!
That’s all! Just forty—— ... Oh, bully, Winslow!
Oh, great stuff! Right through! Three
yards easy! How many downs is that? What?
It can’t be! Oh, all right. We’ll do it, just the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321"></a>[321]</span>
same! They can’t stop us now! We’re on our
way to a touchdown! Get into ’em, Keyes! That’s
the stuff! Rip ’em up! What’d I tell you? Four
more! Oh, there’s nothing to it, I tell you, nothing
to it at all!”</p>

<p>Down on the Green-and-White’s twenty-yard
line now. Mount Morris weakening a little.
Two subs going into her line. Grafton as fresh
as ever, barring Trafford, perhaps. Trafford had
a fierce jolt that time in the third quarter. Enough
to put most fellows out of the game. All right
now! Second down and eight to go! No gain?
Well, Vail can’t do it every time. Besides, they
were looking for him. Two downs left. Seven
to go? Then he did gain a little. Here we go!
Right through—— Nothing doing! Who had
the ball? Keyes? Too bad! Bully chance to
score! Have to kick now. Well, three points is
better than nothing, let me tell you! Who’s going
to—— What’s the matter? Oh, quarter over?
Gee, but that was short! All right, everyone up
now! Let ’em have it! “Rah, rah, rah, Grafton!
Rah, rah, rah, Grafton! Grafton! Grafton!
<em>Grafton!</em>”</p>

<p>Bowles found he was clutching his knees tightly,
doing no possible good to his respectable trousers,
and straining his respectable gloves. Odd how
excited one got about football! Extremely rough,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322"></a>[322]</span>
football, but—er—most interesting and—er—manly,
of course. Oh, rather! Ah, they were
starting again at the other end of the field! A
scarlet-legged youth was standing well behind his
fellows with outstretched arms. Hello, he’d kicked
it! Why didn’t the people applaud? What was
wrong? Oh, it had to go over that stick, eh, and
it hadn’t gone over? Oh, yes, of course. Most
regrettable!</p>

<p>Back to the kicking game again now. Long
punts, thrilling catches and wonderful runs nipped
in the bud by desperate tackles. Now and then
an attempted forward pass by Grafton, but never
successful. Mount Morris playing as if she’d be
satisfied with an 0 to 0 tie, taking no chances
with the ball in her possession, playing it safe always.
Grafton growing more desperate every
minute as the time shortens. Sending Vail and
Keyes banging into the left of the Green-and-White
line for short gains, whisking Blake and
Winslow past tackle or outside end for slightly
longer ones, until again the ball is near the twenty-five
yards. Now the gains are shorter. Mount
Morris plays doggedly, hurling back attack. Three
downs and only five yards gained. Back to the
thirty-two stalks Keyes. A hush settles over the
field and stand. The quarter’s signals are heard
plainly. A brown streak into Keyes’ hands, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323"></a>[323]</span>
swinging foot, a moment of suspense, and a groan
of disappointment. Again he has failed!</p>

<p>Across the field Mount Morris is cheering
slowly over and over and over. Only six minutes
now. Here and there people are already leaving
their seats, to the discomfort of others. Mount
Morris’s ball on her forty-six yards. Rush—rush—rush—punt!
That’s her game now. Hold them
off! No score for either side! Back comes Grafton.
Four yards—that was Winslow through
tackle-guard on the left. Three yards more—that
was Vail outside tackle. Third down and only
three needed. Nick makes it on a delayed run,
gets it by an inch only, but gets it! First down
again on Grafton’s twenty. Hello, what’s this?
A punt on first down? Not likely! A forward
pass then. Yes! And made it, too!</p>

<p>Near the forty now and still going. But she’ll
never get to the goal that way. There isn’t time
enough. Three minutes left? Is that all? Why
don’t they try another forward pass or run the
ends? It’s the only way. Plugging the line will
never—There he goes! He’s off! It’s Winslow!
No, it’s Vail! Ten yards—fifteen—! Oh, bully
tackle, Mount Morris! First down again, though,
and on their thirty or thereabouts. Here’s where
we score! Bust ’em up, Grafton!</p>

<p>Time out for someone. A Grafton player?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324"></a>[324]</span>
No, he’s got green legs. It’s Milton, their right
half. No, it isn’t, it’s that big left guard of theirs.
Looks groggy, doesn’t he? Pretty near all in, if
you ask me. Here comes a Grafton sub; Zanetti,
isn’t it? Wonder who they’ll take out. Winslow,
by thunder! That’s wrong! Winslow’s playing
a dandy game. What? I don’t care if Zanetti
does want his letter. Let him wait until next year.
He’s only an Upper Middler, anyway. Yah!
Ted Trafford’s sent him off again! Now go
ahead, Winslow, and show them we don’t <em>need</em>
any subs!</p>

<p>The Mount Morris chap’s up. He’s going off.
No, he isn’t! That’s right, give him a hand.
Here we go! Put it over, Grafton! Touchdown!
Touchdown! <em>Touchdown!</em></p>

<p>Vail fails to gain on a crisscross and Dresser,
running from position, takes the ball from Nick
and makes two around the other end. Grafton’s
trying to work over in front of goal. Once more,
and Vail gets another two yards through center.
Hard luck! Fourth down now and we’ll have to
kick. Unless—— No, it’s a kick. You can tell
from the formation. Wait a bit, though. Blake’s
edging over. It’s a forward pass! If it only
works! Watch ’em now! Who’s got it? What’s
wrong? Hi! There he goes! <em>There he goes!</em>
Around this end! It’s Bert Winslow! Oh, <a href="#i_frontis">go it, </a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325"></a>[325]</span>
<a href="#i_frontis">you Winslow!</a> Oh, go—They’ve got him! No!
He’ll do it, he’ll do it! Ten yards more! Look
out for that man! Dodge him! That’s it! Oh,
bully! He’s past! He’s—<em>he’s over</em>! HE’S
OVER! <em>Touchdown! Touchdown! Grafton!
Grafton!</em> WO-A-OW!... I beg pardon, sir,
did I break your hat?</p>

<small>HUGH IS UNMASKED!</small></h2>
</div>


<p class="cap">Grafton had won!</p>

<p>That she had done so only by the
slimmest of chances and in the last moments
of time, that Mount Morris had held her
helpless through fifty-eight minutes of that long-drawn
sixty, that the Green-and-White had actually
gained more ground by rushing, and had, all
in all, shown more football skill, was of no moment
now. Tomorrow, in a calmer frame of mind,
Grafton might realize all this, but today the fact
of victory was all she heeded!</p>

<p>She captured the scarlet-legged players, who,
wearied and panting, begged for mercy, and carried
them shoulder-high about the field. She
snake-danced and tossed hats and caps over the
crossbars. She cheered and sang and cavorted
and laughed and triumphed. And finally she
crowded in front of the field house and, Joe Leslie
waving his scarlet megaphone and leading,
cheered every member of the eleven and Coach<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327"></a>[327]</span>
Bonner and Coach Crowley and Trainer Richards
and Manager Quinn, and then cheered the
Team and the School! And, at last, as twilight
settled down, she dispersed across the green and
back to the buildings, still laughing, still singing,
still shouting.</p>

<p>The final score was 7 to 0, for Captain Ted
Trafford, with Nick holding the ball for him, had
finished his football career at Grafton by sending
the pigskin straight and high over the crossbar
and registering the last point for the Scarlet-and-Gray.</p>

<p>But where all had played well and some more
than well, it was Left Half Winslow who had
emerged the hero of the game and of the season.
It was Bert who had torn off that last thirty yards
on a brilliant, zig-zag rush around the unsuspecting
Mount Morris left end and past a half-dozen
desperate defenders, and one cannot perform a
feat like that and escape the consequences. As
Mr. Smiley said when he stopped to shake hands
with Bert at the entrance of Lothrop later, “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sic
itur ad astra</i>,” very freely translated by Nick into
“Thus one becomes a star”!</p>

<p>Hugh, who had patiently waited for Bert to
emerge from the field house and had walked back
through the dusk with him and Nick and Pop and
several others, was still bubbling praise and congratulations<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328"></a>[328]</span>
as, having left the rest, they toiled
up the last flight.</p>

<p>“It was simply corking, Bert!” he declared for
the tenth time. “I don’t see yet how you ever got
through! Why, there were at least five fellows
between you and the goal line! Twice I was sure
you were done for and closed my eyes, and each
time, when I looked again, you were still nipping
it! It was perfectly ripping!”</p>

<p>“Just the same it ought to have been you, old
man. I don’t forget that, you bet!”</p>

<p>“I’d never have done it,” replied Hugh with
conviction. “They’d have nailed me sure as shooting.”
He swung open the door of the study and,
followed by Bert, groped his way toward the
switch. As he did so a discreet cough sounded in
the gloom. “Hello,” exclaimed Hugh. “Who’s
there?”</p>

<p>“Bowles, sir. I tried to find the switch, sir,
but——”</p>

<p>“<em>Who?</em>”</p>

<p>“Bowles, sir. I——”</p>

<p>“<em>Bowles!</em>” The light flared and Hugh faced
the occupant of the study in amazement. Then
he sprang forward and seized the embarrassed
Bowles by the hand. “Bowles! I say, wherever
did you drop from? What are you doing here,
eh?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329"></a>[329]</span></p>

<p>“Her Ladyship thought——”</p>

<p>“You remember Bowles, Bert? He was with
me that day I came.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” replied Bert, shaking hands rather,
as it seemed, to Bowles’ horror. “How are you,
Bowles?”</p>

<p>“Nicely, thank you, sir. I——”</p>

<p>“But, I say, what’s the idea?” demanded Hugh.
“Is the mater here?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. Her Ladyship—<em>Ouch!</em> Beg pardon,
sir!” Bowles discreetly stepped out of the reach
of Hugh’s toes. “I mean to say, Master Hugh,
that your mother was worried when she received
your——”</p>

<p>“Shut up, Bowles! Don’t be a babbling ass!
You mean my mother sent you up to see what
was going on, eh? Well, that’s all right, only
it wasn’t necessary, you know. I’m quite
O. K. Glad to see you, though. You might
sit down and stop fidgeting. When did you get
here?”</p>

<p>“About a quarter to three, sir. There was—h’m—a
misunderstanding about trains, sir, and I
was obliged to engage a fly at the Junction.”</p>

<p>Hugh chuckled. “You’d get the trains balled
up if it was anyway possible, wouldn’t you,
Bowles? Well, never mind that now you’re
here. You’re going to stick around until tomorrow,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330"></a>[330]</span>
I take it. I say, Bert, can he get any supper
here?”</p>

<p>“Surest thing you know! We’ll tell Jimmy and
he’ll fix Bowles up downstairs. And he can sleep
on the window-seat, if you like.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, sir, thanking you, sir! I wouldn’t
think of it, sir. I’m informed there’s a very comfortable
inn in the village, sir.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s better,” agreed Hugh. “You
can have your supper here and then stick around
while the fun lasts. You see, Bowles, we’re
due for a bit of a jolly rumpus tonight. This
is the day we celebrate, if you know what I
mean.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, quite so. I—I witnessed the football
contest, sir.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you did? And you saw Mr. Winslow
make his touchdown? Well, say, Bowles, wasn’t
that a little bit of all right?”</p>

<p>“Quite remarkable, sir! Yes, indeed, sir. A
most clever bit of work, Mr. Winslow, if you’ll
pardon my saying it.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, Bowles. I’m going to get into some
clean togs, Hugh. It must be—Hello! Come
in!”</p>

<p>Nick and Pop and Ted Trafford crowded
through the door and for a minute confusion ruled.
Then, while Pop and Ted held Bert captive in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331"></a>[331]</span>
Morris chair and playfully pummeled him, Nick’s
voice arose above the tumult.</p>

<p>“Well, if it isn’t my old friend Bowler!”
shouted Nick. “Bowler, old top, how’s everything
at dear old Glyndestoke?” Nick was ringing
Bowles’ hand enthusiastically and Bowles’ face
was a study. “When did you leave the Manor,
Bowler? Fellows, meet Mr. Bowler!”</p>

<p>“Begging your pardon, sir,” stammered the
man, “Bowles, if you please, sir!”</p>

<p>“Bowles, of course! Stupid of me, eh, what?
Fellows——”</p>

<p>“Cut it out, Nick,” begged Hugh. “Bowles ran
up to see how things were getting on, don’t you
know. Got here for the game and had the time
of his life, didn’t you, Bowles?”</p>

<p>“Good for Bowles!” cried the incorrigible Nick.
“He’s a true sport! You’ve only to look at him
to know that!” Nick threw himself on the window-seat,
only to arise as quickly and lift from
the cushion the battered remains of what had once
been a most respectable derby hat. Nick viewed
it with surprise and awe, and—I fear—delight!
“Bowles, is this yours?” he asked tremulously.</p>

<p>A silence fell over the room. Then someone
chuckled and a burst of laughter arose as Bowles
meekly assented.</p>

<p>“I’m awfully sorry,” declared Nick, looking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332"></a>[332]</span>
quite otherwise. “I’ll buy you another, Bowles.”</p>

<p>“It’s of no consequence, sir,” said Bowles. “In
fact, sir, it was already—er—a bit damaged. A
young gentleman at the football game, sir, used
it—er—quite roughly, sir!”</p>

<p>The laughter redoubled and into it, having
knocked without receiving any answer, came a
half-dozen fellows; Keyes and Roy Dresser and
Tom Hanrihan, of the first, and Brewster Longley
and Neil Ayer, of the second, and Wallace
Cathcart, non-combatant.</p>

<p>“Proctor!” shouted Ted. “Less noise, gentlemen!”</p>

<p>“Hello, Wal!” greeted the irrepressible Nick.
“Just in time, old top!” He flourished the
squashed and mutilated hat. “We’re celebrating
the finish of the Derby!”</p>

<p>“Too much row, Wal?” asked Bert.</p>

<p>Cathcart shook his head. “I guess a little noise
is to be expected today, Bert,” he answered. “I
saw the crowd and just came over to congratulate
you.”</p>

<p>“Good old Wal!” shouted Nick. “Speech!
Speech! Shut up, fellows, Cathcart’s going to
speech!”</p>

<p>But Cathcart shook his head and smiled. “I’ve
said it,” he replied.</p>

<p>“Short and to the point,” applauded Roy Dresser.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333"></a>[333]</span>
“Brevity, young gentlemen, is the soul of wit.
Say, Hobo, what happened to you, anyway? I’ve
heard forty-eleven yarns. Why didn’t you play?”</p>

<p>“Yes, what’s the real answer?” demanded Hanrihan.</p>

<p>“Bowles’ll know,” declared Nick. “Speak up,
Bowles, old top! Gentlemen, we have with us this
evening ’is ’Ighness’s tried and trusted retainer,
Mr. Bowles. A short cheer for Bowles, fellows!”</p>

<p>“Rah, rah, rah! Bowles!” was the instant and
enthusiastic response. Bowles looked distinctly uncomfortable,
although he tried hard to smile a
respectful smile.</p>

<p>“Now, then, Bowles, out with it!” demanded
Nick. “What was this vile conspiracy to——”</p>

<p>“Really, sir, I’m not at liberty——”</p>

<p>“Bowles, shut up!” warned Hugh sharply.</p>

<p>“Hobo, don’t interfere,” cried Roy Dresser.
“Someone muzzle him.”</p>

<p>He wasn’t muzzled, but several fellows so
engaged his attention for a minute that speech
was impossible.</p>

<p>“Now, Bowles, once more. You were saying?”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, sir, but I’m not at liberty
to speak, sir. His Lordship——”</p>

<p>There was a smothered groan from the struggling
Hugh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334"></a>[334]</span></p>

<p>“Who?” asked Nick.</p>

<p>“That is, sir, Master Hugh——”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute,” exclaimed Bert, pushing forward.
“You said something about ‘his Lordship,’
Bowles. Who did you mean?”</p>

<p>Bowles cast an anguished look across the table
toward Hugh, but no help came to him for the
reason that Hugh was very, very busy.</p>

<p>“No one, sir. A—a figure of speech, if you
please, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, all right, Bowles. Proceed. Tell us
your sweet, sad story,” prompted Nick.</p>

<p>“Hold on,” interrupted Bert. “Let’s get this
straight. There’s something queer here.”</p>

<p>“Several,” murmured Nick.</p>

<p>“Who’s his Lordship, Bowles? Do you mean
Hugh?”</p>

<p>“Really, Mr. Winslow——” began the perturbed
Bowles.</p>

<p>At that instant Hugh threw off the enemy and
bounded to his feet. “Bowles!” he cried. “Shut
up! Get out of here!”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said Bowles with vast relief. But
Bert interposed.</p>

<p>“Don’t you do it, Bowles,” he commanded.
“Let’s get this straight.”</p>

<p>“Bowles!” cautioned Hugh sternly.</p>

<p>“Let him talk. Free speech!” said Longley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335"></a>[335]</span></p>

<p>“Fellows,” interrupted Wallace Cathcart
mildly, “we’re making it very difficult for Mr.
Bowles. Besides, he’s not going to tell you anything,
and I will, if you’ll be quiet a minute.”</p>

<p>“Shoot!” said Nick. “Shut up, everyone! Go
ahead, Wal.”</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose Hugh will want my life
blood,” went on Cathcart, smiling at Hugh’s
frowning and anxious countenance, “but I’ll trust
to you fellows to save me.”</p>

<p>“He shan’t touch a bone of your head,” Pop
assured him.</p>

<p>“I know he doesn’t want it known, fellows, but
I don’t see why it shouldn’t be. Besides, it’s bound
to get out some time, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“I guess so,” agreed Nick. “What are you
talking about?”</p>

<p>“It was something Hugh let drop in my room
one day that made me—well, suspicious. There’s
a book in the library that tells all about the English
nobility and titled families and all that, you
know, and so I had a look at it. Hugh had told
me that he lived at a place called Glyndestoke, and
so the rest was easy.”</p>

<p>Everyone was silent and curious, everyone save
Hugh. Hugh was palpably unhappy.</p>

<p>“I say, Wal, if you know anything, shut up,
won’t you?” he begged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336"></a>[336]</span></p>

<p>“Don’t intimidate the witness,” said Pop. “Go
ahead, Cathcart. What did you discover?”</p>

<p>“I discovered,” continued Cathcart after an
apologetic glance at Hugh, “that the owner of
Lockely Manor in Glyndestoke, Hampshire—or
Hants, as Hugh calls it—England, is the Marquis
of Lockely, who is some sort of a secretary
in the Ministry; I’ve forgotten what.”</p>

<p>“Political Secretary, Colonial Office, sir, begging
your pardon,” said Bowles proudly.</p>

<p>“Also,” continued Cathcart, with a twinkle in
his eye, “I discovered that the aforementioned
Marquis of Lockely has one son, Hugh Oswald
Brodwick, Earl of Ordway!”</p>

<p>Number 29 was so still for an instant that you
could have heard a pin drop! Then someone said,
“<em>Gee!</em>” very fervently, and a dozen fellows all
began to talk at once. But it was Bert’s voice
which dominated the others.</p>

<p>“Is that so, Hugh?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Oh, dry up,” answered Hugh. “I—I’d like
to punch your head, Cathcart!”</p>

<p>“I was afraid you would,” replied Cathcart
sadly.</p>

<p>“The Earl of Ordway!” gasped Nick. “<em>What—do—you—know—about—that?</em>”</p>

<p>“I’m not an earl,” declared Hugh uncomfortably.
“It—it’s only a courtesy-title. And,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337"></a>[337]</span>
anyhow, I don’t see what difference it makes!”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t, Hobo! Not a bit!” said Pop soothingly.
“We’ll all try to forget it and let you live
it down. After all, it isn’t your fault, is it, fellows?”</p>

<p>“Of course not!” laughed Hanrihan. “<em>He</em>
couldn’t help it! Buck up, Hobo! No one’s going
to hold it against you!”</p>

<p>Bowles gasped. “Against his Lordship, sir!
<em>Against</em> him?”</p>

<p>“Bowles, shut up! I’m not your Lordship.
I’m——” Hugh’s puckered brow smoothed and
he laughed—“I’m just Hobo Ordway. Now forget
it, fellows, won’t you? It’s all piffling poppycock,
anyway! That’s just what it is, by Jove,
piffling poppycock, if you know what I mean!”</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
